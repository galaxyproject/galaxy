This is a planning and discussion issue for enhancements I would like to make to Galaxy's logging system.  

# TL;DR

I want to add `logger.trace()` calls to the Galaxy codebase, but before doing that I would like to get some infrastructure in place.

# What is proposed

1. Enhance support for the `trace()` method that is already present in `galaxy.util.custom_logging`
1. Add a simplified logging configuration section to either `galaxy.yml` or a separate logging config file
1. Add API endpoints to query and set logging levels at runtime
1. Add an admin panel that gives administrators a GUI for setting log levels on a running instance.

# What is not proposed

1. Providing an API that allows arbitrary logger reconfiguration.  We only need (want) to change the logging level at runtime.  No other configuration changes will be allowed.
1. Changing the way loggers are currently configured.  The logging configuration changes proposed here work transparently with the current logging configuration methods.
2. Doing everything now.  This is a first pass and we can add more features and enhancements later.

# Proof of concept

I have a proof of concept running that implements the first three items (everything but the admin panel). The code is available in the [logging-enhancements](https://github.com/ksuderman/galaxy/tree/logging-enhancements) branch of my Galaxy fork.

However, before I start submitting PRs there are a number of design decisions to resolve.

## The trace() method

My proof of concept is based on the collective wisdom of [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35804945/1691778).  

If we monkeypatch Python's `logging` library early enough in the code loading process then the `trace()` method is automagically available to all loggers.  There are ~750  configured loggers in a running Galaxy instance.

This works well in a running Galaxy instance, but may present problems for Galaxy packages meant to be used as libraries. Calling `galaxy.util.logging.addTraceLoggingLevel()` in the [package.__init__.py](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/packages/package.__init__.py) may be sufficient. The goal is to make it as easy as possible for developers to add `trace()` calls to their code and not require the use of a special logger class.

## Logging configuration

The proof of concept implementation adds a `logging_levels` section to the `galaxy.yml` file. This could also be done in a separate configuration file.  The purpose of the `logging_levels` section is to provide an easier way to set the logging levels for groups of loggers in a single statement.

```
logging_levels:
  galaxy.*: ERROR
  galaxy.jobs.runners.*: DEBUG
  galaxy.jobs.runners.kubernetes: TRACE
```

## Changes at runtime

Adding `trace()` level logging statements has the potential to blow up log files and Galaxy should not be configured to use `TRACE` as the default logging level. Therefore we will need some way to enable `TRACE` level logging at runtime.  Options include, but are not limited to:

1. set up a file watcher on the config file and reconfigure loggers when changes are detected
2. provide an API that allows log levels to be changed.  

These are not mutually exclusive options, but in some situations, e.g. AnVIL, users may not have access to the configuration files. 

The proof of concept provides a simple API that allows the level to be changed at runtime. Adding a config watcher can be added at a later date if needed.

```
curl http://localhost:8080/api/logging
curl http://localhost:8080/api/logging/galaxy.jobs.runners.* 
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/logging/galaxy.jobs.runners.*?level=DEBUG
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/logging/galaxy.jobs.runners.kubernetes?level=TRACE
```
For brevity I have omitted setting the API key. Only administrators can list or change the logging levels.


The first `GET` method returns JSON containing information for all currently configured loggers.  The second `GET` method returns information for a single logger or all loggers in a particular package.  The `POST` method can be used to set the logging level for a single logger or all the loggers in a package. 

# TODO

## Authorization

All API endpoints specify `require_admin=True` in the `@router` decorator.  Is this sufficient? I was thinking of adding checks in relevant `galaxy.util.logging` methods, but is this necessary?

## Admin GUI

I have not started on an admin panel yet, but I envision it would be a new option in the *Server* section of the admin panel.  The logging panel would contain a table and/or a tree view of all the loggers and their current levels and the ability to set the levels for loggers.  I will need help and guidance with this task.  

## Naming

I've used that I thought were reasonable names for the names of packages, API endpoints, function names, and configuration options, but I'm open to suggestions. This also applies to general code layout and structure.
