This wrapper script largely serves as a point documentation and convenience for
running Galaxy's Python tests. All Python tests shipped with Galaxy can be run with
pytest directly. Galaxy's client unit tests can be run with make client-test
or yarn directly as documented in detail in client/README.md.

The main test types are as follows:

- API: These tests are located in lib/galaxy_test/api and test various aspects of the Galaxy
   API and test general backend aspects of Galaxy using the API.
- Integration: These tests are located in test/integration and test special
   configurations of Galaxy. All API tests assume a particular Galaxy configuration
   defined by test/base/driver_util.py and integration tests can be used to
   launch and test Galaxy in other configurations.
- Framework: These tests are all Galaxy tool tests and can be found in
   test/functional/tools. These are for the most part meant to test and
   demonstrate features of the tool evaluation environment and of Galaxy tool XML
   files.
- Unit: These are Python unit tests either defined as doctests or inside of
   test/unit. These should generally not require a Galaxy instance and should
   quickly test just a component or a few components of Galaxy's backend code.
- Selenium: These are full stack tests meant to test the Galaxy UI with real
   browsers and are located in lib/galaxy_test/selenium.
- ToolShed: These are web tests that use the older Python web testing
   framework twill to test ToolShed related functionality. These are
   located in lib/tool_shed/test.

Python testing is done via pytest. Specific tests can be selected
using the syntax described at https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/usage.html .
A few examples are shown below.

Run all API tests:
    ./run_tests.sh -api

The same test as above can be run using pytest directly as follows:
    pytest lib/galaxy_test/api

However, when using pytest directly, output options defined in this
file aren't respected and a new Galaxy instance will be created for each
Test class (this scripts optimizes it so all tests can share a Galaxy
instance).

Run a full class of API tests:
    ./run_tests.sh -api lib/galaxy_test/api/test_tools.py::TestToolsApi

Run a specific API test:
    ./run_tests.sh -api lib/galaxy_test/api/test_tools.py::TestToolsApi::test_map_over_with_output_format_actions

Run all selenium tests (Under Linux using Docker):
    # Start selenium chrome Docker container
    docker run -d -p 4444:4444 -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm selenium/standalone-chrome:3.0.1-aluminum
    GALAXY_TEST_SELENIUM_REMOTE=1 ./run_tests.sh -selenium

Run a specific selenium test (under Linux or Mac OS X after installing geckodriver or chromedriver):
    ./run_tests.sh -selenium lib/galaxy_test/selenium/test_registration.py::TestRegistration::test_reregister_username_fails

Run a selenium test against a running server while watching client (fastest iterating on client tests):
    ./run.sh & # run Galaxy on 8080
    make client-dev-server & # watch for client changes
    export GALAXY_TEST_EXTERNAL=http://localhost:8081/  # Target tests at server.
    . .venv/bin/activate # source the virtualenv so can skip run_tests.sh.
    pytest lib/galaxy_test/selenium/test_workflow_editor.py::TestWorkflowEditor::test_data_input

Note About Selenium Tests:

If using a local selenium driver such as a Chrome or Firefox based one
either chromedriver or geckodriver needs to be installed an placed on
the PATH.

More information on geckodriver can be found at
https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver and more information on
chromedriver can be found at
https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/ .

By default Galaxy will check the PATH for these and pick
whichever it finds. This can be overridden by setting
GALAXY_TEST_SELENIUM_BROWSER to either FIREFOX, CHROME, or something
more esoteric (including OPERA).

If PyVirtualDisplay is installed Galaxy will attempt to run this
browser in a headless mode. This can be disabled by setting
GALAXY_TEST_SELENIUM_HEADLESS to 0 however.

Selenium can also be setup a remote service - to target a service set
GALAXY_TEST_SELENIUM_REMOTE to 1. The target service may be configured
with GALAXY_TEST_SELENIUM_REMOTE_PORT and
GALAXY_TEST_SELENIUM_REMOTE_HOST. By default Galaxy will assume the
remote service being targetted is CHROME - but this can be overridden
with GALAXY_TEST_SELENIUM_BROWSER.

In this remote mode, please ensure that GALAXY_TEST_HOST is set to a
host that is accessible from the Selenium host. By default under Linux
if GALAXY_TEST_SELENIUM_REMOTE is set, Galaxy will set this to be the IP
address Docker exposes localhost on to its child containers. This trick
doesn't work on Mac OS X and so GALAXY_TEST_HOST will need to be crafted
carefully ahead of time.

For Selenium test cases a stack trace is usually insufficient to diagnose
problems. For this reason, GALAXY_TEST_ERRORS_DIRECTORY is populated with
a new directory of information for each failing test case. This information
includes a screenshot, a stack trace, and the DOM of the currently rendered
Galaxy instance. The new directories are created with names that include
information about the failed test method name and the timestamp. By default,
GALAXY_TEST_ERRORS_DIRECTORY will be set to database/errors.

The Selenium tests seem to be subject to transient failures at a higher
rate than the rest of the tests in Galaxy. Though this is unfortunate,
they have more moving pieces so this is perhaps not surprising. One can
set the GALAXY_TEST_SELENIUM_RETRIES to a number greater than 0 to
automatically retry every failed test case the specified number of times.

External Tests:

A small subset of tests can be run against an existing Galaxy
instance. The external Galaxy instance URL can be configured with
--external_url. If this is set, either --external_master_key or
--external_user_key must be set as well - more tests can be executed
with --external_master_key than with a user key.

Extra options:

 --verbose_errors      Force some tests produce more verbose error reporting.
 --no_cleanup          Do not delete temp files for Python functional tests
                       (-toolshed, -framework, etc...)
 --coverage            Generate a test coverage report. This option currently
                       works with every Python test, but the
                       results may not be reliable with Selenium or other
                       frameworks that primarily test the client.
 --debug               On python test error or failure invoke a pdb shell for
                       interactive debugging of the test
 --report_file         Path of HTML report to produce (for Python Galaxy
                       functional tests). If not given, a default filename will
                       be used, and reported on stderr at the end of the run.
 --xunit_report_file   Path of XUnit report to produce (for Python Galaxy
                       functional tests).
 --skip-venv           Do not create .venv (passes this flag to
                       common_startup.sh)
 --external_url        External URL to use for Galaxy testing (only certain
                       tests).
 --external_master_key Master API key used to configure external tests.
 --external_user_key   User API used for external tests - not required if
                       external_master_key is specified.
  --skip_flakey_fails  Skip flakey tests on error (sets
                       GALAXY_TEST_SKIP_FLAKEY_TESTS_ON_ERROR=1).

Environment Variables:

In addition to the above command-line options, many environment variables
can be used to control the Galaxy functional testing processing. Command-line
options above like (--external_url) will set environment variables - in such
cases the command line argument takes precedent over environment variables set
at the time of running this script.

General Test Environment Variables

GALAXY_TEST_COVERAGE            If set, it is equivalent to passing the
                                --coverage option.
