Developer Documentation
=======================

There are two primary areas of documentation developers will be interested in:

- `Codebase Documentation`_ for developers of Galaxy
- `API Documentation`_ for developers of third party tools interacting with Galaxy

Additionally there is an `FAQ`_ document for new Galaxy developers answering common "How Do I..." questions.

.. _Codebase Documentation: ../lib/modules.html
