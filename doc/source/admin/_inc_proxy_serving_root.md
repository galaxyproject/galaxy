This configuration assumes that Galaxy will be the only site on your server using the given hostname (e.g.
``https://galaxy.example.org``).

Beginning with Galaxy Release 22.01, the default application server that Galaxy runs under is Gunicorn. Because of this,
the HTTP protocol should be used for communication between {{ PROXY }} and Galaxy, rather
than the uWSGI protocol used in earlier version of this document.
Legacy instructions for proxying via uWSGI can be found in the {{ '[Galaxy Release 21.09 proxy documentation](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_21.09/admin/{}.html)'.format(PROXY|lower) }}.

Since {{ PROXY }} is more efficient than Gunicorn at serving static content, it is best to serve it directly, reducing the load
on the Galaxy process and allowing for more effective compression (if enabled), caching, and pipelining. Directives to
do so are included in the example below.
