# Proxying Galaxy with NGINX

In a production environment, it is recommended to run Galaxy behind a proxy web server for performance and security
reasons. The proxy server sits between clients and your Galaxy server, relaying requests between them and offloading
some of the more menial and resource-intensive tasks.

[NGINX][nginx] is a lightweight HTTP server designed with high performance proxying in mind. The Galaxy Project's public
servers, [usegalaxy.org][main] ("Main") and [Test][test], as well as the [Docker Galaxy project][docker-galaxy] use
NGINX, rather than Apache, to proxy Galaxy. NGINX was chosen for its simple, fast load balancing and other
proxy-oriented features.

Instructions for [proxying with Apache](apache.md) are also available.

## Prerequisites

```{include} _inc_proxy_prereq.md
```

### NGINX Proxy Prerequisities

If you are **not** planning to use the recommended [tus.io method](#receiving-files-via-the-tus-protocol) to handle file uploads but want to use nginx to handle uploads, you will (most likely) not be able to use your package manager's version of nginx. The [Receiving Files With NGINX](#receiving-files-with-nginx-legacy) section explains this in detail and provides some options for installing *nginx + upload module* packages maintained by the Galaxy Committers Team.

Otherwise, your system package manager's version of nginx should be suitable. Under Debian, the
[nginx-light][nginx-light] package contains all the necessary modules used in this guide. On EL, the [EPEL][epel]
version of nginx is suitable.

## Basic Configuration

```{include} _inc_proxy_ssl.md
```

### Serving Galaxy at the Web Server Root

```{include} _inc_proxy_serving_root.md
```

The following configuration is not exhaustive, only the portions most relevant to serving Galaxy are shown, these should
be incorporated with your existing/default nginx config as is appropriate for your server. Notably, the nginx package
you installed most likely has a multi-file config layout. If you are not already familiar with that layout and where
best to place your configuration, you can learn more in the [Proxy Package Layouts](proxy_package_layout)
documentation.

```nginx
http {

    #...

    # compress responses whenever possible
    gzip on;
    gzip_http_version 1.1;
    gzip_vary on;
    gzip_comp_level 6;
    gzip_proxied any;
    gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/x-javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;
    gzip_buffers 16 8k;

    }

    server {

        listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;

        # use a variable for convenience
        set $galaxy_root /srv/galaxy/server;

        # proxy all requests not matching other locations to Gunicorn
        location / {
            proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_pass http://unix:/srv/galaxy/var/gunicorn.sock;
        }

        # serve framework static content
        location /static {
            alias $galaxy_root/static;
            expires 24h;
        }
        location /robots.txt {
            alias $galaxy_root/static/robots.txt;
            expires 24h;
        }
        location /favicon.ico {
            alias $galaxy_root/static/favicon.ico;
            expires 24h;
        }

        # serve visualization and plugin static content
        location ~ ^/plugins/(?<plug_type>.+?)/(?<vis_name>.+?)/static/(?<static_file>.*?)$ {
            alias $galaxy_root/config/plugins/$plug_type/$vis_name/static/$static_file;
            expires 24;
        }
    }
}
```

Be sure to set `$galaxy_root` to the path to your copy of Galaxy and modify the value of `proxy_pass` to match your
Gunicorn socket path. With the default configuration, gunicorn will bind to a TCP socket, so you will need to Gunicorn to bind to a UNIX domain socket as described in the [Scaling and Load Balancing](scaling.md) documentation. If using a UNIX domain
socket, be sure to pay particular attention to the discussion of users and permissions.

### Additional Notes

- **Do not** simply copy the SSL configuration directives and expect them to work on your server or to be secure! These
  are provided as examples of some of the best practices as of the time of writing, but will not always be up to date.
  Use the guides referenced in [basic configuration](#basic-configuration) section to configure SSL properly.
- If your existing nginx configuration contains a line or included config file defining a default server, be sure to
  disable it by commenting its `server {}` or preventing its inclusion (under Debian this is done by removing its
  symlink from `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`).
- `proxy_read_timeout` can be adjusted as appropriate for your site. This is the amount of time allowed for
  communication between nginx and Gunicorn to block while waiting for a response from Galaxy, and is useful for holding
  client (browser) connections while Gunicorn is restarting Galaxy subprocesses or Galaxy is performing a slow operation.
- The parameter `client_max_body_size` specifies the maximum upload size that can be handled by POST requests through
  nginx. You should set this to the largest file size that you wish to allow for upload and that could be reasonably
  handled by your site. It defaults to 1MB, so it will need to be increased if you are dealing with genome sized
  datasets.
- If you must serve Galaxy without SSL, you would simply replace the `listen` directives in the SSL `server {}` block
  with the `listen` directives from the non-SSL `server {}` block and remove the non-SSL block and SSL directives from
  the `http {}` block.
- If the proxy works but you are getting 404 errors for Galaxy's static content, be sure that the user that nginx runs
  as has access to Galaxy's `static/` directory (and all its parent directories) on the filesystem. You can test this on
  the command line with e.g. `sudo -u www-data ls /srv/galaxy/server/static`.

### Serving Galaxy at a URL Prefix

It may be necessary to serve Galaxy from an address other than the web server root (`https://www.example.org/galaxy`),
instead of `https://galaxy.example.org`). To do this, you need to make the following changes to the configuration in the
previous section:

1. In the nginx config, prefix all of the location directives with your prefix and redirect requests from `/prefix` to
   `/prefix/` like so:

    ```nginx
            #...

            # proxy all requests not matching other locations to Gunicorn
            location /galaxy {
                proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_pass http://unix:/srv/galaxy/var/gunicorn.sock:/galaxy;
            }

            # serve framework static content
            location /galaxy/static {
                alias $galaxy_root/static;
                expires 24h;
            }

            # additional static locations...

            # redirect /prefix -> /prefix/
            rewrite ^/galaxy$ /galaxy/ last;
    ```

2. The Galaxy application needs to be aware that it is running with a prefix (for generating URLs in dynamic pages).
   This is accomplished by configuring Galaxy in your `config/galaxy.yml` file like so and restarting Galaxy:

    ```yaml
    gravity:
      gunicorn:
        # ...
        bind: /srv/galaxy/var/gunicorn.sock
        extra_args: '--forwarded-allow-ips="*"'
        # ...
    galaxy:
        # ...
        galaxy_url_prefix: /galaxy
        # ...
    ```

    ```{note}
    Older versions of Galaxy required you to set the ``cookie_path`` option. This is no longer necessary as of
    Galaxy release 19.05 as it is now set automatically, but the (now undocumented) option still remains and
    overrides the automatic setting. If you have this option set, unset it unless you know what you're doing.
    ```

   Be sure to consult the [Scaling and Load Balancing](scaling.md) documentation.

## Advanced Configuration Topics

### Sending Files With Nginx

Galaxy sends files (e.g. dataset downloads) by opening the file and streaming it in chunks through the proxy server.
However, this ties up the Galaxy process, which can impact the performance of other operations (see [Production Server
Configuration](production.md) for a more in-depth explanation).

Nginx can assume this task instead and, as an added benefit, speed up downloads. In addition, the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV), the Integrated Genome Browser (IGB), and the JBrowse tool (run within Galaxy) require support for the HTTP *Range* header, and this is only available if the proxy serves datasets.
This is accomplished through the use of the special `X-Accel-Redirect` header. Dataset security is maintained in this configuration because nginx will still check with Galaxy to ensure that the requesting user has permission to access the dataset before sending it.

To enable it, add the following to your Galaxy's `server {}` block:

```nginx
        location /_x_accel_redirect/ {
            internal;
            alias /;
            # Add upstream response headers that would otherwise be omitted
            add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin $upstream_http_access_control_allow_origin;
            add_header Access-Control-Allow-Methods $upstream_http_access_control_allow_methods;
        }
```

Next, edit `galaxy.yml` and make the following change before restarting Galaxy:

```yaml
galaxy:
    #...
    nginx_x_accel_redirect_base: '/_x_accel_redirect'
```

For this to work, the user under which your nginx server runs will need read access to Galaxy's `files_path` directory
(by default, `database/files/`) and its contents. This is most easily done by adding the nginx user to the Galaxy user's
primary group and setting the `umask(2)` to create files with the group read permission set. If you start Galaxy from
the command line, you can do this like so:

```shell-session
admin@server$ sudo usermod -a -G galaxy www-data    # add `www-data` user to `galaxy` group
admin@server$ sudo -iu galaxy
galaxy@server$ umask 027
galaxy@server$ sh run.sh
```

If you start Galaxy from supervisord, you can set the `umask` option in the [program
section](http://supervisord.org/configuration.html#program-x-section-settings) after adding the nginx user to the Galaxy
group as shown above.

### Receiving Files via the tus protocol

[tus](https://tus.io/) is a protocol based on HTTP for resumable file uploads. Resumable means that an upload can be interrupted at any moment and can be resumed without re-uploading the previous data again. An interruption may happen willingly, if the user wants to pause, or by accident in case of an network issue or server outage.

Galaxy includes a WSGI middleware that implements a tus server for which no configuration is needed.
However the middleware ties up resources on the Galaxy server process, and uploads will be interrupted
while Galaxy restarts. A more efficient alternative is to run an external server that implements the tus protocol.
Any tus server will work. Here we will use [tusd](https://github.com/tus/tusd).
Binaries can be downloaded from https://github.com/tus/tusd/releases/.

In this example we will set up tusd to:

- listen on port 1080 on localhost (`-host localhost -port 1080`)
- store uploads in database/tmp (replace this with the value of new_file_path in your galaxy.yml config) (`-upload-dir=<galaxy_root>/database/tmp`)
- send an event via http to /api/upload/hooks to ensure the user is logged in (`-hooks-http=<galaxy_url>/api/upload/hooks`)
- forward authentication headers in that event (`-hooks-http-forward-headers=X-Api-Key,Cookie`)

The complete command is thus (replace `<galaxy_url>` with your Galaxy URL and `<galaxy_root>` with the path to your Galaxy installation):

```sh
tusd -host localhost -port 1080 -upload-dir=<galaxy_root>/database/tmp -hooks-http=<galaxy_url>/api/upload/hooks -hooks-http-forward-headers=X-Api-Key,Cookie
```

We now need to set up nginx to proxy requests to /api/upload/resumable_upload to our tusd server.
To do this, add the following to your Galaxy's `server {}` block:

```nginx
        location /api/upload/resumable_upload {
        # Disable request and response buffering
            proxy_request_buffering  off;
            proxy_buffering          off;
            proxy_http_version       1.1;

            # Add X-Forwarded-* headers
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

            proxy_set_header         Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header         Connection "upgrade";
            client_max_body_size     0;
            proxy_pass http://localhost:1080/files;
        }
```

If you serve Galaxy at a prefix exchange `/api/upload/resumable_upload` with `/prefix/api/upload/resumable_upload`.

After reloading the nginx configuration you can verify that this configuration works correctly by uploading a file to Galaxy. Make sure the tusd server logs the request. It should look similar to the following

```
[tusd] 2021/10/12 13:30:14 Using '/Users/mvandenb/src/galaxy/database/tmp' as directory storage.
[tusd] 2021/10/12 13:30:14 Using 0.00MB as maximum size.

```

Note that the tusd server does not need to run on the same host that serves Galaxy.
See the [tusd documentation](https://github.com/tus/tusd#documentation) for additional information.

### Receiving Files With Nginx (Legacy)

As of Galaxy release 22.01 we recommend setting up tusd to upload files.
The instructions below will continue to work for older, legacy client applications,
but the Galaxy user interface will not use this method of uploading files.

Galaxy receives files (e.g. dataset uploads) by streaming them in chunks through the proxy server and writing the files
to disk. However, this again ties up the Galaxy process. nginx can assume this task instead and as an added benefit,
speed up uploads. This is accomplished through the use of
[nginx_upload_module](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/modules/upload/), a 3rd-party nginx module.

To enable it, you must first download, compile and install nginx with the upload module, since prior to NGINX 1.11.5,
nginx did not support shared modules, and the upload module is not yet shared-compatible. Because this is a tedious
and complicated process, the Galaxy Committers team maintains (for some platforms) versions of nginx modified from their
upstream package sources (APT, EPEL, etc.) to include the upload module:

- [Ubuntu (PPA)](https://launchpad.net/~galaxyproject/+archive/ubuntu/nginx) (Be sure to install `nginx-extras`, not `nginx`)
- [Enterprise Linux](https://depot.galaxyproject.org/yum/)

To contribute support for additional platforms, please see the [Galaxy
Starforge](https://github.com/galaxyproject/starforge) project, which is used to do the repackaging.


Once nginx with the upload module is installed, create a directory in which to store uploads (ideally, for performance
reasons, on the same filesystem as Galaxy's datasets) and add the necessary directives to `nginx.conf`:

```nginx
user galaxy;

http {

    #...

    server {

        #...

        # handle file uploads via the upload module
        location /_upload {
            upload_store /srv/galaxy/upload_store;
            upload_store_access user:rw group:rw;
            upload_pass_form_field "";
            upload_set_form_field "__${upload_field_name}__is_composite" "true";
            upload_set_form_field "__${upload_field_name}__keys" "name path";
            upload_set_form_field "${upload_field_name}_name" "$upload_file_name";
            upload_set_form_field "${upload_field_name}_path" "$upload_tmp_path";
            upload_pass_args on;
            upload_pass /_upload_done;
        }

        # once upload is complete, redirect to the proper galaxy path
        location /_upload_done {
            set $dst /api/tools;
            if ($args ~ nginx_redir=([^&]+)) {
                set $dst $1;
            }
            rewrite "" $dst;
        }
}
```

Note the `user` directive at the top, outside of the `http {}` block. To ensure that Galaxy has write permission on the
uploaded files, nginx's workers will need to run as the same user as Galaxy.

When serving Galaxy at a URL prefix as described in the [Serving Galaxy at a URL
prefix](#serving-galaxy-at-a-url-prefix) section, you will need to change `set $dst /api/tools;` to `set $dst
/prefix/api/tools;` (e.g. `set $dst /galaxy/api/tools;`).

Finally, edit `galaxy.yml` and make the following change before restarting Galaxy:

```yaml
galaxy:
    #...
    nginx_upload_store: /srv/galaxy/upload_store
    nginx_upload_path: '/_upload'
```

### Creating archives with mod-zip

Galaxy creates zip archives when downloading multiple datasets from a history or a dataset library.
While this works fine for small datasets and few users, nginx can handle the creation of zip archives
more efficiently using [mod-zip](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/modules/zip/).
To use this feature, install nginx with mod-zip enabled (requires <https://github.com/evanmiller/mod_zip/commit/51cf45d3e9f51e02224af017b235d1d30fbf28fb> or a newer), provide the file locations from which
nginx should serve files and edit `galaxy.yml` and make the following changes before restarting Galaxy:

```yaml
galaxy:
    #...
    upstream_mod_zip: true
```

Instead of creating archives Galaxy will send a special header containing the list of files to be archived.
nginx needs to be able to serve these files. To serve files from /galaxy_root/database/files
create the following location:

```nginx
http {

    #...

    server {

        #...

        # handle archive create via mod-zip
        location /galaxy_root/database/files/ {
            internal;
            alias /galaxy_root/database/files/;
        }
}
```

The `internal;` statement means that the location can only be used for internal nginx requests.
For external requests, the client error 404 (Not Found) is returned, meaning users cannot
access arbitrary datasets in `/galaxy_root/database/files/` .

Note that if you allow linking datasets from filesystem locations in your data libraries,
these paths need to exposed in the same way.

### Use Galaxy Authentication to Protect Custom Paths

You may find it useful to require authentication for access to certain paths on your server.  For example, Galaxy can
run a separate reports app which gives useful information about your Galaxy instance. See the [Reports Configuration
documentation](./reports) and [Peter Briggs' blog post on the
subject](https://galacticengineer.blogspot.com/2015/06/exposing-galaxy-reports-via-nginx-in.html) for more.

After successfully following the blog post, Galaxy reports should be available at e.g. `https://galaxy.example.org/reports`.
To secure this page to only Galaxy administrators, adjust your nginx config accordingly:

```nginx
        location /reports {
            #...
            satisfy any;            # only one auth method needs to succeed
            deny all;               # host-based auth is not allowed
            auth_request /_auth;    # forward authentication
        }

        location /_auth {
            #internal; probably?
            # The used galaxy api endpoint is only available to galaxy admins and thus limits the access
            # to only logged in admins.
            proxy_pass http://localhost/api/configuration/dynamic_tool_confs;
            proxy_pass_request_body off;
            proxy_set_header Content-Length "";
            proxy_set_header X-Original-URI $request_uri;
        }
```
