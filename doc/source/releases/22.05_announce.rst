===========================================================
May 2022 Galaxy Release (v 22.05)
===========================================================

.. include:: _header.rst

Highlights
===========================================================

**The new History is the default History**
  See the `22.05 user release notes <22.05_announce_user.html>`__ for details.

**Galaxy is now exclusively a FastAPI application**
  As announced in the release notes for Galaxy Release 22.01 we have removed support to run Galaxy as a WSGI application.
  If you are still using uWSGI please consult the `Migrating to Gunicorn documentation <https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/latest/admin/migrating_to_gunicorn.html>`__.

**Deferred dataset resolution**
  Optional deferred dataset resolution enables users to select that datasets fetched from URLs or remote file sources should not be fetched into Galaxy's objectstore.
  Deferred datasets are only fetched when jobs using these datasets are run.

**Enhanced Celery tasks and features**
  Galaxy can optionally delegate the data upload job to Celery, and Galaxy can run the metadata script in Celery. This results in much shorter runtime for small jobs.
  To enable this, set `enable_celery_tasks` to `true` and ensure that at least one celery worker is started.
  If Celery tasks are enabled, it is also possible to change the datatype for many history items in batch.

**Galaxy has a new database migrations system based on Alembic.**
  The new migrations system is built on top of Alembic. The SQLAlchemy Migrate tool has been retired. 
  For usage, see `Galaxy's migrations documentation <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/release_22.05/lib/galaxy/model/migrations/README.md>`__.
  For an architectural overview, see `pull request #13108 <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/13108>`__.
Also check out the `22.05 user release notes <22.05_announce_user.html>`__

Get Galaxy
==========

The code lives at `GitHub <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy>`__ and you should have `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`__ to obtain it.

To get a new Galaxy repository run:
  .. code-block:: shell

      $ git clone -b release_22.05 https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy.git

To update an existing Galaxy repository run:
  .. code-block:: shell

      $ git fetch origin && git checkout release_22.05 && git pull --ff-only origin release_22.05

See the `community hub <https://galaxyproject.org/develop/source-code/>`__ for additional details on source code locations.

Changed
-------

The following configuration options have been changed

config/galaxy.yml.sample:galaxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  mapping.galaxy.mapping.debug.desc has changed from

   ::

    Debug enables access to various config options useful for development
    and debugging: use_lint, use_profile, and use_printdebug.  It also
    causes the files used by PBS/SGE (submission script, output, and error)
    to remain on disk after the job is complete.
    
    In addition, this will set uWSGI's `honour-stdin` option to `true`;
    thus, preventing uWSGI from remapping stdin to `/dev/null` and
    enabling debugging with tools like pdb. To keep uWSGI's default
    setting, set `honor-stdin` to `false` in the `uwsgi` section of this
    configuration file.

-  mapping.galaxy.mapping.logging.desc has changed from

   ::

    Controls where and how the server logs messages. If unset, the default is to log all messages to standard
    output at the level defined by the `log_level` configuration option. Configuration is described in the
    documentation at:
    https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/config_logging.html

    Controls where and how the server logs messages. If set, overrides all settings in the log_* configuration
    options. Configuration is described in the documentation at:
    https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/config_logging.html


-  mapping.galaxy.mapping.metadata_strategy.desc has changed from

   ::

    Determines how metadata will be set. Valid values are `directory` and `extended`.
    In extended mode jobs will decide if a tool run failed, the object stores
    configuration is serialized and made available to the job and is used for
    writing output datasets to the object store as part of the job and dynamic
    output discovery (e.g. discovered datasets <discover_datasets>, unpopulated collections,
    etc) happens as part of the job.

   to

   ::

    When the simplified workflow run form is rendered, should the invocation outputs
    be sent to the 'current' history or a 'new' history. If the user should be presented
    and option between these - set this to 'prefer_current' or 'prefer_new' to display
    a runtime setting with the corresponding default. The default is to provide the
    user this option and default it to the current history (the traditional behavior
    of Galaxy for years) - this corresponds to the setting 'prefer_current'.
