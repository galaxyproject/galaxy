Highlights
===========================================================

**Interactive Tools**
  A new type of Galaxy tool has been implemented that allow interactive experiences like
  Galaxy Interactive Environments (via a proxy and Docker containers) but using plugins defined with
  Galaxy's XML tool syntax. Dan Blankenberg's slides on these new features from Galaxy
  Community Conference can be found `here <https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/gcc2019/c1/S8A-4__Dan_Blankenberg_Tools.pdf>`__.
  More information can be found in the original pull request including interactive tool
  versions of all of Galaxy's bundled interactive environments `Pull Request 7494`_.

**Workflow Invocation Reports**
  Workflows may now define Markdown templates with Galaxy specific embedded syntax extensions
  that can tie together workflow inputs, outputs, jobs, and metadata into rich reports.
  More information on the motivation for these reports can be found in `these slides <bit.ly/gxreports19>`__,
  implementation details and GUI enhancements are described in the original pull request
  (`#8030 <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/8030>`__), and details on the final
  syntax selected for embedded Galaxy objects can be found in the pull request that was ultimately
  merged (`#8543 <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/8543>`__).  

**New Toolshed Client Interface**
  The march toward replacing templated backend generated HTML with modern, reactive
  components continued in Galaxy 19.09. Galaxy's tool panel, job properties tables,
  job management controls, and "Pages" infrastructure were all replaced with VueJS
  components (with huge help from `@scrathat <https://github.com/scrathat>`__
  and `@inkuzmin <https://github.com/inkuzmin>`__). Most notably, Galaxy's interface
  to the Toolshed was also rewritten in VueJS and is now completely API driven.
  This project drove numerous enhancements to the Toolshed API including vastly improved
  search functionality. This interface has been completely re-imagined and feels much
  more interactive.
