Highlights
===========================================================

Activity Bar Interface
--------------------------

23.1 introduces the Activity Bar, a new customizable interface element designed
for swift navigation through various sections of the application. The feature is
currently opt-in, and you can try it today by enabling it in User Preferences.
Upcoming releases will enable this by default for all users, and will extend
functionality with new activities and by allowing users to drag items such as
datasets and workflows directly from the UI into the activity bar component.

Carbon Emissions Reporting
---------------------------

Monitor your environmental impact with our new Carbon Emissions Reporting
feature. This feature is available on the job information page, allowing users
to track their carbon footprint in real-time. The calculations assume global
average values for carbon intensity and power usage effectiveness.  Monitor your
carbon footprint and become inspired to better your relationship with the
environment!

History Archival Feature
-------------------------
The history menu has a new option to move a history out of your active histories
and into an archive.  When archiving a history, you will be presented with two
options: either to “Keep the Storage Space” or to “Free the Storage Space” taken
up by the history. Keeping the storage space will keep the contents of the
history where they are, allowing them to be restored at any moment, but will
prevent the UI from allowing certain operations on the history. Freeing the
storage space will prompt you to package and export the history to a permanent
remote source as a backup snapshot, and then will purge the history and its
contents to free up storage space. There will be a simple list, titled Archived
Histories, for you to explore your archived histories and restore and reimport
them, as needed!

Visualize HDF5 Datasets
------------------------

Users can now visualize their HDF5 datasets directly in Galaxy, thanks to the
integration of the h5web visualizer (https://h5web.panosc.eu/)!

Galaxy Notification Framework
-----------------------------
Galaxy now contains a universal notification framework.  This will facilitate
sending notifications about a wide variety of scenarios like job completion,
artifact sharing, server updates, and more.  Users have control over their
notifications, including the option to subscribe/unsubscribe from certain types
of notifications.  The new notification system also supports broadcast
notifications, allowing administrators to send server-wide announcements, such
as server maintenance or downtime notifications.
