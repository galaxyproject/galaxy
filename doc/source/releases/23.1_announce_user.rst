Highlights
===========================================================

Carbon Emissions Reporting!
---------------------------

Stay on top of your carbon emissions contributions by enabling our new reporting
feature! Initial implementation of carbon emissions reporting has now been added
to the job information page. Monitor your carbon footprint in real-time and
become inspired to better your relationship with the environment! Currently,
this feature assumes global average values for carbon intensity and power usage
effectiveness.

History Archival Feature!
-------------------------
Your history menu now has a new option move a history out of your active history
and into an archive! When archiving a history, you will be presented with two
options: one to “Keep the Storage Space” and one to “Free the Storage Space”
taken up by the history. Keeping the storage space will keep the contents of the
history where they are, allowing them to be restored at any moment, but will
prevent the UI from allowing certain operations on the history. Freeing the
storage space will prompt you to package and export the history to a permanent
remote source as a backup snapshot, and then purge the history and its contents
to free up storage space. There will be a simple list, titles Archived
Histories, for you to explore your archived histories and restore and reimport
them, as needed!

Galaxy Notification System!
---------------------------
The previous Galaxy notification system has been overhauled to support more
complex scenarios and features! As users, you will now have more control of your
notifications, including the option to subscribe/unsubscribe from certain times
of notifications. The new notification system will also support notification
broadcasting, allowing the Galaxy team to send server-wide announcements, such
as User Agreement updates and server maintenance notifications.

Power User Features
===================

Attention long time Galaxy users! Are you looking to enhance your skills? Check
out these new features to take your Galaxy skills to the next level!

Visualize HDF5 Datasets!
------------------------

Users can now visualize their HDF5 datasets directly in Galaxy, thanks to the
integration of the h5web visualizer (https://h5web.panosc.eu/)!

Create New Activity Bar Items!
------------------------------

The new option to create activity bar items allows users to drag items,
including datasets and workflows, from the UI directly into the activity bar
component! In addition, the context menu has been augmented, now allowing to
search activities.

Invocations Related to a History!
---------------------------------

Users now have the option to see invocations related to a specific history in
Galaxy!
