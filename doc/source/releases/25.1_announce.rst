Admin Notes
===========================================================

**Removal of the Trackster Visualization in Galaxy release 25.1**
  The legacy Trackster genome browser visualization
  `has been completely removed from Galaxy <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/20974>`__. This includes
  the removal of special handling for Trackster across tool execution, tool box filtering, visualization
  framework features, controller endpoints, client code, and other conditional logic. With the removal of
  Trackster, the era of Mako-based visualizations served from controller endpoints ends.

  Galaxy now provides the modern IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer) as the primary genome browser
  visualization, offering superior functionality and performance for genomic data exploration.

Deprecation Notices
===========================================================

**Deprecation of Mako-based visualizations in Galaxy release 26.0**
  With the removal of Trackster in 25.1, the remaining legacy Mako-based visualization framework
  and controller endpoints are deprecated and
  `will be completely removed in Galaxy 26.0 <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/21133>`__.
  Any remaining Mako-based visualizations should be migrated to the modern script-based visualization
  plugin framework. Users and administrators are encouraged to transition to supported visualization
  plugins to ensure continued functionality and access to new features.

**Deprecation of the Galaxy Reports application in Galaxy release 26.0**
  The standalone Galaxy Reports application, which provides administrative usage statistics and
  analytics for Galaxy instances, is deprecated and will be removed in Galaxy 26.0.
  The Reports app was a separate web application that connected to the Galaxy database to display
  information about jobs, workflows, users, and system usage. Administrators currently using the
  Reports app should plan to migrate to alternative monitoring and analytics solutions before
  Galaxy 26.0 is released next year.
