**Galaxu UI plugins - Webhooks**
  We introduce Galaxy Webhooks - optiuonal plugins for the web UI that allow for better customization of your instance. See the `documentation <https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/webhooks.html>`__.

Deprecation Notices
===================

* API-like endpoints (returning JSON) that start with ``<galaxy>/root/`` in the URL are now deprecated and will be removed in future releases. Please use proper API (e.g. ``/api/histories`` or ``/api/tools``) to replace your implementations.
* The ``jsonp`` parameter for search API endpoints in Tool Shed is deprecated and will be removed in the future. Instead the presence of a ``callback`` argument will trigger the JSONP format to be returned.
