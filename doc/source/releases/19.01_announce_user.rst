Highlights
===========================================================

**Revised UI Style**

The Galaxy styling has been substantially reworked resulting in the largest visual refresh to Galaxy in years. It should provide a much cleaner and more consistent interface.

**More Colourful Tags**

Whenever you use dataset name tags (``#tag``), they will randomly be assigned a color. The colors are consistent; anywhere that tag with the same text appears in your history, it will have the same color. This should increase visual distinction between similarly shaped words, making it easier to track data flow in complex analyses.

**Extensive Workflow Enhancements**

The workflow editor now features new tool-like inputs which provide non-file data (such as numbers, text, true/false, colors) which can be connected to tool inputs. You are no longer restricted to only using files as inputs to tools!

The workflow editor allows you to specify that specific inputs should be exposed, and can thus be connected to the new workflow inputs.

**New Help Site**

There's a new discussion forum to replace Biostars. It is accessible under the 'Help' menu on some Galaxies, or at https://help.galaxyproject.org
