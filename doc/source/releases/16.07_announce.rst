Highlights
===========================================================

**Shift of Galaxy tool dependencies to Conda**
  Galaxy admins obtained the ability to install Galaxy tool's
  dependencies using the Conda package manager. This is a Beta feature
  and we encourage interested deployers to opt-in by modifying configuration.
  Documentation that explains this switch and answers FAQ is :doc:`available <../admin/conda_faq>`.

**Dynamic tool destinations**
  Our friends from Canada National Microbiology Laboratory enhanced
  Galaxy with feature that allows dynamic mapping of tools to destinations
  based on finer grained admin-specified rules. Please see the
  `wiki <https://galaxyproject.org/admin/config/jobs/#Dynamic_Destination_Mapping>`__.
  Implemented in `PR #2579 <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/2579>`__

**Galaxy chat**
  Admins can now plug in the included communication server to enable
  users of their instance to use real-time chat within the Galaxy interface.
  Implemented in `PR #2515 <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/2515>`__
