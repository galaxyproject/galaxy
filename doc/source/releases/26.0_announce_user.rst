Highlights
===========================================================

Discover some of the most exciting new capabilities and improvements in Galaxy 26.1.

AI Comes to Galaxy
------------------

Galaxy 26.1 brings artificial intelligence directly into the Galaxy experience, expanding how users explore data, discover tools, and troubleshoot analyses.

ChatGXY: Intelligent Assistance Inside Galaxy
---------------------------------------------

Galaxy introduces **ChatGXY**, a built in AI assistant integrated directly into the interface.

- **Conversational help**. Ask questions about tools, workflows, results, or errors without leaving Galaxy.
- **Error analysis guidance**. Receive contextual explanations and suggestions when jobs fail.
- **Tool recommendations**. Describe your analysis goal and get suggestions tailored to the tools installed on your Galaxy instance.
- **Training discovery**. Find relevant Galaxy Training Network tutorials directly from within Galaxy.
- **Extensible architecture**. Built on a flexible agent framework designed to grow with additional specialized AI capabilities over time.

ChatGXY provides a conversational entry point to Galaxy's AI capabilities and lays the groundwork for connecting Galaxy users to an expanding set of intelligent capabilities.

AI Assisted Notebooks with JupyterLite
--------------------------------------

Galaxy 26.1 strengthens integration with **JupyterLite**, bringing AI enhanced notebooks directly into your browser.

- **Browser based notebooks**. Launch lightweight, interactive notebooks connected to Galaxy data.
- **AI powered exploration**. Use AI assistance within notebooks to prototype analyses and accelerate exploration.
- **Seamless data access**. Work with Galaxy datasets without manual downloads or complex setup.
- **Shared AI services**. Notebook AI features use Galaxy's configured AI services for consistent behavior and control.

This integration makes interactive, AI supported analysis a natural extension of Galaxy workflows.

AI Powered Data Visualization with Vintent
------------------------------------------

Galaxy introduces **Vintent**, an AI driven visualization engine for generating interactive charts from your data.

- **Natural language to visualization**. Turn requests into structured, validated charts.
- **Modern Vega Lite charts**. Create expressive and interactive visualizations directly within Galaxy.
- **Integrated with Galaxy datasets**. Visualizations operate directly on your data without extra preparation.
- **Reproducible browser based Python runtime**. Data transformations run in a versioned Pyodide environment directly in the browser.
- **Consistent, versioned environments**. Visualization logic uses pinned dependencies, making environments portable, reproducible, and easy to evolve independently.

By combining AI reasoning with a portable and reproducible Python runtime in the browser, Vintent expands Galaxy's visualization ecosystem while preserving flexibility and isolation.

A Redesigned ToolShed Landing Experience
----------------------------------------

The ToolShed landing page has been redesigned to make tool discovery clearer and more focused.

- **Prominent search box**. Quickly find Galaxy tools from a central search interface.
- **Clear guidance sections**. Learn how to find, install, publish, and cite tools.
- **Streamlined layout**. A simplified two column design highlights essential information and recent repositories.

These improvements make exploring and managing Galaxy tools more intuitive for both new and experienced users.

Automated Actions When Workflows Finish
---------------------------------------

Galaxy 26.1 adds configurable actions that automatically execute when a workflow completes.

- **Automatic result export**. Send workflow outputs to remote file sources such as cloud storage.
- **Completion notifications**. Receive alerts when long running workflows finish.
- **Configurable at launch**. Select post run actions directly in a new On Completion section of the workflow run form.
- **Track recent exports**. Monitor export status and review recent transfers from within Galaxy.

These features streamline post analysis workflows and reduce manual follow up steps.

Improved Workflow Error Navigation
----------------------------------

Debugging complex workflows is now easier with clearer and more actionable failure hints.

- **Clickable failure paths**. Navigate directly to the exact failing step, even within subworkflows.
- **More precise step hints**. See clearer guidance on where and why a failure occurred.
- **Faster troubleshooting**. Reduce time spent locating and diagnosing workflow issues.
