Highlights
===========================================================

Empower Users to Build More Kinds of Collections, More Intelligently
--------

Galaxy’s collection system has been vastly expanded, simplifying creation while supporting new,
advanced use cases for both users and developers.

- **Support for mixed paired and unpaired collections**. Tools and workflows can now work with
  lists that contain both paired and unpaired data (`list:paired_or_unpaired`), supporting more
  flexible scientific analyses and tool development. A new collection operation tool lets you
  split such collections into homogeneous lists if needed.
- **Generalized collection creation**. Easily build these new generalized collection types—including
  nested lists (`list:list`), nested lists of pairs (`list:list:paired`), and more—directly from
  selected datasets, without requiring rules.
- **Wizard-style collection builders**. A new wizard component guides users step-by-step,
  auto-detecting data structures and suggesting the most appropriate collection format. Choose
  between "Auto Build List" for instant setup or "Advanced Build List" for full manual control,
  with tailored help and warnings.
- **New Rule Based Import Activity**. An activity-based wizard for rule-based uploads gives more
  space, clarity, and flexibility. Notably, you can now drop files directly onto the “Paste Table”
  form, and work with rules in a more consistent, central location.
- **Better error handling and feedback**. The new interfaces provide clear feedback and tailored
  warnings for duplicate identifiers and unpaired datasets, streamlining the user experience.
- **Refinements and bug fixes**. Includes fixes for extension handling, improved abstractions for
  collection input adaptation, and refactoring for easier future maintenance.

These changes make collection creation more powerful and accessible, supporting both simple and
sophisticated data organization scenarios, and laying the groundwork for future enhancements.

Here's an example of one of the new collection builders in action:

Add ZIP explorer to import individual files from local or remote ZIP archives
--------

Galaxy now features a ZIP explorer, streamlining the process of importing individual files from both
local and remote ZIP archives.

- **ZIP explorer integration**. Browse the contents of ZIP files directly in Galaxy and select only the
  files you need, minimizing unnecessary uploads.
- **Support for local and remote archives**. Import from ZIP files on your computer or by providing a
  remote URL.
- **Improved user experience**. The intuitive interface simplifies file selection and import, making it
  easier to work with compressed data.

These enhancements make importing data from ZIP archives more flexible and efficient, further reducing
barriers to working with large or complex datasets.

Dataset View Component
--------

Galaxy 25.0 introduces a centralized view for datasets, consolidating common dataset actions into a
single, streamlined interface.

- **Single access point**. Instead of multiple separate buttons, users now interact with a single
  button on each dataset, which opens a tabbed interface for all dataset-related actions.
- **Tabbed layout**. Key functionality — such as viewing metadata, peeking into file contents,
  accessing datatypes/permissions and more — is now organized into clear, intuitive tabs.
- **Improved usability**. This update provides a one stop shop for dataset management,
  reducing clutter and confusion from multiple buttons and options.

This change enhances consistency across the Galaxy interface and offers a more intuitive experience
for both new and experienced users working with datasets.

Add rerun option for workflows
--------

Users can now easily rerun any workflow with the exact same inputs and parameters as a previous run - 
with a simple click of the new "Rerun" button in the workflow invocation view. This feature streamlines
reproducibility and troubleshooting by letting you repeat analyses with a single click. The workflow run
form also detects and notifies of any changes to inputs compared to the original run!
[`#20032 <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/20032>`__]

An Enhanced Workflow Run Form Interface
--------

Galaxy 25.0 introduces a streamlined workflow run interface that allows users to upload inputs, create
collections, and configure parameters — all within a single, unified form.

- **Integrated data upload and collection creation**. Users can now upload datasets or build
  collections directly from the workflow run form, without navigating away or switching contexts.
- **Visual input indicators**. Each input now displays a visual status indicator, making it easy to see
  which inputs are ready and which still need attention.
- **Improved settings panel**. The run form includes a clearer, more organized settings menu with
  well-annotated options for configuring the workflow execution.
- **Live-updating workflow graph**. A dynamic graph of the workflow appears alongside the form,
  updating in real time as users populate inputs — helping them understand the structure and flow
  of the analysis.

These improvements were inspired by users encountering curated workflows from platforms like the IWC
Browser or BRC Analytics, and are designed to reduce friction, improve clarity, and enable users to
complete complex analyses entirely within a single interface.
[`#19294 <https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/19294>`__]

Introducing READMEs for Workflows in the Galaxy Interface
--------

Galaxy 25.0 introduces support for associating README/help text with workflows. This provides a way to
document workflows directly in the Galaxy interface, with support for Markdown formatting, links, and
images.

- **README field for workflows**. Each workflow can now have an associated README string, stored as part
  of the workflow object but separate from the workflow steps or structure.
- **Viewable on the run form**. A new "Show Workflow Help" button on the workflow run form reveals
  associated documentation alongside input parameters — helping users understand how to use a workflow.
- **Editable from the workflow editor**. Workflow authors can scroll the "Attributes" panel in the
  editor, click "Show Readme," and add or update the associated documentation.

This feature lowers the barrier to understanding and reusing workflows, especially in collaborative
environments.
