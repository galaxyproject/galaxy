This README file describes the DRMAA Condor UNIX C library.

Most parts of this code were written by Nicholas Geib, a former member of the
Condor development team.  Peter Troeger from the DRMAA working group is now
responsible for the finalization and ongoing improvement of the code. 

In case of problems, please use the feedback mechanisms on the according
Sourceforge project page:

This library was developed from the Distributed Resource Management Application
API Specification 1.0 of January 2004 and the DRMAA C Bindings v1.0. Both were
available at time of writing at www.drmaa.org. 

The library expects a POSIX-compliant Unix system, with support for the pthread
library. It contains support only for the Condor system, and has been tested
with the latest releases from the Condor 6.7 and 6.8 series.

The library supports all mandatory parts of the DRMAA 1.0 API. See the STATUS
file for details about what has not yet been fully implemented.

REQUIREMENTS:

The library requires the following in order to operate.  The program linked to
the library is referred to as the "user process".

1) A local schedd must be running. If you have installed this machine as Condor
submission host, this should be the case.
2) The user process must have sufficient spool space.  This space should be in
/tmp or specified by the environment variables TEMP, TMP, or SPOOL.
3) The user process and local schedd must have read, write, and traverse rights
to the spool space.
4) On platforms where libpthread, the POSIX threading library, is supported the
user process must be linked with libpthread when it uses the static DRMAA
library.

BUILD & INSTALLATION:

This package can be build independently from Condor with the usual autoconf
stuff. Currently, there is no install target, so you have to copy one of the
resulting libraries to the right place:

./configure
make
cp libdrmaa.so /usr/lib/ 
cp drmaa.h /usr/include/

The build process was tested on Linux (x86 and IA64) and MacOS X, but might
also work on other Unix platforms.

CAUTION:

1. The libcondordrmaa.a static library is build for backward-compatibility to
the first version of DRMAA in Condor. Please note that the DRMAA specification
expects a shared library, so your application should rely on libdrmaa.so
instead.

2. The DRMAA library submits jobs in the Vanilla universe. If you want to work
with jobs in the standard universe, please provide an according specification
("universe=standard") in the 'native specification' attribute of the job
template or use job category options in /etc/drmaa file, e.g.:

[categories]
standard_category = Universe = standard
some_other_category = Requirements = (OpSys == "WINNT51")

3. DRMAA_WD (working directory) is implemented using Initialdir so it is not
possible to set a working (execution) directory when filesystems are not shared
in Condor.

4. DRMAA_TRANSFER_FILES attribute does not support hostname syntax in
DRMAA_INPUT_PATH, DRMAA_OUTPUT_PATH and DRMAA_ERROR_PATH paths.

5. If DRMAA_TRANSFER_FILES is used and is not empty, the executable is
transferred from submit to execution host implicitely by Condor. There is also
no way of turning of the transfer of output/error files between submit and
execution hosts.

This is non-standard behaviour and should not relied on in portable programs.
