unix:
  commandLine: |
    Galaxy typically runs a class of software called "command-line applications". A command
    line is essentially a string that describes what application should be run and what parameters
    it should be run with.

    More information on command lines can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).
  exitCode: |
    An exit code is a numeric representation of how an application execution has completed. An exit code of value 0 typically indicates successful execution of an application, while other values indicate a failure.

    More information on exit codes can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status).
  stdout: |
    When an application is executed most of its reporting, diagnostic, and logging messages are printed to a stream of
    data called the "standard output" (often abbreviated as stdout). Error messages are more typically
    printed to an alternative stream called "standard error".

    More information on standard output can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams).
  stderr: |
    When an application is executed most of its error messages are typically printed to a stream of
    data called the "standard error" (often abbreviated as stderr). Other reporting, diagnostic, and
    logging messages are typically printed to an alternative stream called "standard output".

    More information on standard error can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams).
  traceback: |
    A "traceback" is also often called a "stack trace". This is typically used to describe what is
    happening at various levels of an application at an instant in time and can sometimes be used to
    debug what is wrong with the execution of an application.

    More information on stack traces can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_trace).

galaxy:
  jobs:
    states:
      # upload, waiting, failed, paused, deleting, deleted, stop, stopped, skipped.
      ok: |
        This state indicates the job completed normally and Galaxy did not detect any errors with execution. 
      new: |
        This state indicates the job is ready to be run. Typically this means a Galaxy job handler will schedule
        the job and place it into a queued state on its next iteration.
      queued: |
        This state indicates that Galaxy has scheduled the job and some external resource has placed it in a queue.
        Typically, once the job has reached the front of that queue it will be executed and transitioned to the
        'running' state.
      error: |
        This state indicates that Galaxy has attempted to execute this job and there was some issue.
      failed: |
        This state indicates that Galaxy has attempted to execute this job and it completed but Galaxy
        detected some issue with the execution.
      running: |
        This state indicates that Galaxy is currently running this job. After the job is complete, it will
        likely be transitioned to a 'failed' or 'ok' state.
      paused: |
        This state indicates that Galaxy has paused attempts to execute this job. This can be because
        upstream jobs have failed and so inputs will not become available or because job or quota limits
        have been reached.

  invocations:
    states:
      scheduled: |
        This state indicates the workflow invocation has had all of its jobs scheduled. This means all the
        datasets are likely created and Galaxy has created the stubs for the jobs in the workflow. *The jobs
        themselves might not have been queued or running.*

      ready: |
        This state indicates the workflow invocation is ready for additional scheduling steps. This means
        the workflow will likely result in additional datasets and jobs being created over time.

      new: |
        This state indicates the workflow invocation has been queued up but no datasets or jobs have been
        created.

      cancelled: |
        This state indicates the workflow invocation has been cancelled and new jobs or datasets won't
        be created for this workflow. Most cancellations are caused by user interactions. If problems
        scheduling the workflow cause a failure that cannot be recovered from, the state will be failed
        instead of cancelled.

      cancelling: |
        This state indicates the workflow invocation will be cancelled shortly by Galaxy.

      failed: |
        This state indicates there was a problem scheduling the workflow invocation. No additional datasets
        or jobs will be created for this workflow invocation.
