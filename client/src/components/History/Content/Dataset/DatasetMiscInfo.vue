            <p>
                This error message indicates that your history is setup to allow sharing but your job was run in a
                configuration to target a storage location that explicitly disables sharing.
            </p>
            <p>
                To fix this configure your history so that new datasets are private or target a different storage
                location.
            </p>
            <p>
                To re-configure your history, click the history menu and go to the "Set Permissions" option in the
                dropdown. This should result in a toggle that allows you to configure the history so that new datasets
                are created as private datasets.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many ways to instead target different storage for your job. This can be selected in the tool
                or workflow form right before you execute your job or a different default for your history or user can
                be chosen that allows for sharing.
