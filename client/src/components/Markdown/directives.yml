history_dataset_as_image:
  side_panel_name: Image

history_dataset_as_table:
  side_panel_name: Embedded Dataset as table
  help: |
    Embed a dataset in the resulting document as a table. This only works for datasets with tabular

history_dataset_peek:
  side_panel_name: Peek into Dataset
  help: |
    Display a dataset metadata's "peek" field in the resulting document - this is datatype dependent
    metadata but usually this is a few lines from the start of a file.

history_dataset_info:
  side_panel_name: Dataset Details
  help: |
    Display a dataset metadata's "info" field in the resulting document. This info field is
    usually based on the output of the tool run and sometimes contains useful metadata about a

  side_panel_description: as text

  help: |
    Report the current Galaxy version at the time %MODE% generation.

    Warning: This is the Galaxy version at the time the %MODE% was generated and
    not the time of an analysis. This option makes the most sense for PDF generation
    of %MODE%s designed for external archiving or printing.

generate_time:
  side_panel_name: Current Time
  side_panel_description: as text
  help: |
    Report the current time of %MODE% generation.

    Warning: This is the time the %MODE% was generated and not the time of
