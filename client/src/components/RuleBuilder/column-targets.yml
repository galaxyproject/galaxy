    This should be a short description of the replicate, sample name, 
    condition, etc... that describes each level of the list structure.

    This should be set to '1', 'R1', 'forward', 'f', or 'F' to indicate 
    forward reads, and '2', 'r', 'reverse', 'R2', 'R', or 'R2' to indicate 
    reverse reads.

  help: |
    This should be set to '1', 'R1', 'forward', 'f', or 'F' to indicate 
    forward reads, and '2', 'r', 'reverse', 'R2', 'R', or 'R2' to indicate 
    reverse reads. Unmatched '1' for 'forward' elements will be 'unpaired' 
    in the resulting list, alternatively this column can be set to 'u' or 
    'unpaired' to force the element to be unpaired.
