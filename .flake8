[flake8]
# These are exceptions allowed by Galaxy style guidelines:
# B008 Do not perform function calls in argument defaults (for FastAPI Depends and Body)
# E203 is whitespace before ':'; we follow black's formatting here. See https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq.html#why-are-flake8-s-e203-and-w503-violated
# E402 module level import not at top of file # TODO, we would like to improve this.
# E501 is line length
# W503 is line breaks before binary operators, which has been reversed in PEP 8.
# D** are docstring linting - which we mostly ignore except D302. (Hopefully we will solve more over time).
