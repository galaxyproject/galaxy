**Syntax**

- **Genotype data** is the input pedfile chosen from available library files

-----

**Summary**

This tool imports genotype data from a high throughput snp platform into galaxy.
Data in linkage (ped and map files) format are currently importable. Others will
be added. 

A bunch of conversions are done and the results are visible in the data set selection
drop down list for each relevant tool. For example, all the Plink based tools will 
show your new data from now on and same for Marchini's tools and eigenstrat.

Always check the log file (click the "view" (eye) icon) after this tool runs as 
you may need to adjust the missing value if you see a message like:
<pre>
ERROR: Locus rs1063302 has >2 alleles:
       individual 1334 10 has genotype [ N N ]
       but we've already seen [ G ] and [ A ]
</pre>

Originally designed and written for family based data from the CAMP Illumina run of 2007 by 
ross lazarus (ross.lazarus@gmail.com)

Once a file has been imported, it will be available for selection as the input data for tools in the Rgenetics menu that 
operate on the various output files
