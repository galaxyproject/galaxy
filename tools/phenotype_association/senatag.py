"""
This tool takes the following file pairs as input:
a) input_snp  : A file with identifiers for SNPs (one on each line)
b) ldfile     : A file where each line has  the following
                snp     list
                where "snp" is an identifier for one SNP and the "list" is a
                comma separated list of all the other snps that are in LD with
                it (as per some threshold of rsquare)

The output is a set of tag SNPs for the given datasets

The algorithm is as follows:

a) Construct a graph for each population, where each node is a SNP and two nodes
are connected using an edge iff they are in LD.
b) For each SNP, count the total number of connected nodes, which have not yet
been visited.
c) Find the SNP with the highest count and assign it to be a tag SNP.
d) Mark that SNP and all the snps connected to it as "visited". This should be
done for each population.
e) Continue steps b-e until all SNPs, in all populations have been visited.
