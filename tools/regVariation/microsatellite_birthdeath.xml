.. class:: infomark

**What it does**

This tool uses raw orthologous microsatellite clusters (identified by the tool "Extract orthologous microsatellites") to identify microsatellite births and deaths along individual lineages of a phylogenetic tree.
-----

.. class:: warningmark

**Note**

A tab-separated output table (depending on the species being considered) is generated where each row contains all information for a microsatellite locus from multiple species. 
The table typically reads like this:

hg18.chr22	16153057	16153074	A		1	ins=,imot:0:tt;dels=	,9:t>c	-panTro2	hg18:tttttttttttttttttt,ponAbe2:--tttttttttttttttt,panTro2:-----ttttctttttttt

hg18.chr22	16131711	16131722	ATGC	4	NA						,2:C>T	+ponAbe2	hg18:CACGCATGCATG,ponAbe2:CATGCATGCATG,panTro2:CACGCATGCATG,rheMac2:CACGCGTGCATG

Where columns list the following:

1: Chromosome/scaffold/contig  of one of the species. The species chosen is the first species readable in the Newick tree submitted by the user.

2: Start coordinate

3: End coordinate

4: Motif of microsatellite

5: Motif size

6: Insertion and deletion details. Insertions are separated from deletions by a ";", and individual insertions and deletions are separated from others by a comma. For the purpose of illustration, consider the first row listed above:
"imot:0:tt", where imot/imotf again suggest insertion, the number indicates position of insertion within the microsatellite's alignment, and this is followed by identity of nucleotides that are inserted.

7: Substitution details. Individual substitutions are separated by commas. Each entry contains the position of substitution event in the microsatellites' alignment, and the nature of substitution.

8: Inference of birth/death event. Births are indicated by "+", and deaths by "-". Events such as "-hg18:panTro2" suggest death in the common ancestor of hg18 and panTro2, whereas events such as "-hg18.panTro2" indicate parallel, independent death events along the two lineages. Alternative interpretations of the event may also be listed, following a "/", such as:
"+hg18.+panTro2 / +hg18:panTro2"

9: Actual sequences in the alignment, separated by commas.
