**What it does**    
        
**LASTZ** is a high performance pairwise sequence aligner derived from BLASTZ. It is written by Bob Harris in Webb Miller's laboratory at Penn State University. Special scoring sets were derived to improve runtime performance and quality. The Galaxy version of LASTZ is geared towards aligning of short (Illumina/Solexa, AB/SOLiD) and medium (Roche/454) reads against a reference sequence. There is excellent, extensive `documentation`__ on LASTZ available, although it hasn't been updated for the version of LASTZ that Galaxy is running (the key changes have to do with output formats, so it is still extremely helpful).

 .. __: http://www.bx.psu.edu/miller_lab/dist/README.lastz-1.01.50/README.lastz-1.01.50.html
 
------

**Input formats**

LASTZ accepts reference and reads in FASTA format. However, because Galaxy supports implicit format conversion the tool will recognize fastq and other method specific formats.

------

**Outputs**

LASTZ generates one output. Depending on the choice you make in *Select output format* drop-down LASTZ will produce a SAM file showing sequence alignments, a list of differences between the reads and reference (Polymorphisms), or a general table with one line per alignment block (Tabular). Examples of these outputs are shown below.

**SAM output**

SAM has 12 columns::

                                   1     2     3         4   5    6  7         8     9                                    10                                     11  12

   6.      zstart1  Starting position of the alignment block in the target, origin-zero.
   7.         end1  Ending position of the alignment block in the target, expressed either as origin-one closed or origin-zero half-open (the ending value is the same in both systems).
   8.      length1  Length of the alignment block in the target (excluding gaps).
   9.        text1  Aligned characters in the target, including gap characters.

  16.      start2+  Starting position of the alignment block in the query, counting along the query sequence's positive strand (regardless of which query strand was aligned), origin-one. Note that if strand2 is "−", then this is the other end of the block from start2.
  17.     zstart2+  Starting position of the alignment block in the query, counting along the query sequence's positive strand (regardless of which query strand was aligned), origin-zero. Note that if strand2 is "−", then this is the other end of the block from zstart2.
  18.        end2+  Ending position of the alignment block in the query, counting along the query sequence's positive strand (regardless of which query strand was aligned), expressed either as origin-one closed or origin-zero half-open (the ending value is the same in both systems).

  23./24. identity  Fraction of aligned bases in the block that are matches (see Identity). This is written as two fields. The first field is a fraction, written as &lt;n&gt;/&lt;d&gt;. The second field contains the same value, computed as a percentage.
  25./26. coverage  Fraction of the entire input sequence (target or query, whichever is shorter) that is covered by the alignment block (see Coverage). This is written as two fields. The first field is a fraction, written as &lt;n&gt;/&lt;d&gt;. The second field contains the same value, computed as a percentage.
  27./28.  gaprate  Rate of gaps (also called indels) in the alignment block. This is written as two fields. The first field is a fraction, written as &lt;n&gt;/&lt;d&gt;, with the numerator being the number of alignment columns containing gaps and the denominator being the number without gaps. The second field contains the same value, computed as a percentage.
  29.     diagonal  The diagonal of the start of the alignment block in the dynamic programming matrix, expressed as an identifying number start1-start2.
  30.      shingle  A measurement of the shingle overlap between the target and the query. This is intended for the case where both the target and query are relatively short, and their ends are expected to overlap.

**LASTZ Settings**

There are two setting modes: (1) **Commonly used settings** and (2) **Full Parameter List**.

**Commonly used settings**

There are seven modes::

  Illumina-Solexa/AB-SOLiD 95% identity
  Illumina-Solexa/AB-SOLiD 85% identity
  Roche-454 98% identity
  Roche-454 95% identity
  Roche-454 90% identity
  Roche-454 85% identity
  Roche-454 75% identity

when deciding which one to use consider the following: a 36 bp read with two difference will be 34/36 = 94% identical to the reference.  

**Full Parameter List**

This modes gives you a fuller control over lastz. The description of these and other parameters is found at the end of this page. Note, that not all parameters are included in this interface. If you would like to make additional options available through Galaxy, e-mail us at galaxy-bugs@bx.psu.edu.

------

**Do you want to modify reference name?**

This option allows you set the name of the reference sequence manually. This is helpful when, for example, you would like to make reference name compatible with the UCSC naming conventions to be able to display your lastz results as a custom track at UCSC Genome Browser.

  --targetcapsule=&lt;capsule_file&gt;   the target seed word position table and seed
                          (as well as the target sequence)are read from specified file
  --segments=&lt;segment_file&gt;   read segments from a file, instead of discovering
                          them via seeding. Replaces other seeding or gap-free extension
                          options
  --[no]census[=&lt;file&gt;]     count/report how many times each target base aligns
                          (default is to not report census)
  --identity=&lt;min&gt;[..&lt;max&gt;]   filter alignments by percent identity
                          0&lt;=min&lt;=max&lt;=100;  blocks (or HSPs) outside min..max
                          are discarded
                          (default is no identity filtering)
  --coverage=&lt;min&gt;[..&lt;max&gt;]   filter alignments by percentage pf query covered
                          0&lt;=min&lt;=max&lt;=100;  blocks (or HSPs) outside min..max
                          are discarded
                          (default is no query coverage filtering)
  --notrivial             do not output trivial self-alignment block if the target and query 
                          sequences are identical. Using --self enables this option automatically
  --output=&lt;output_file&gt;  write the alignments to the specified file name instead of stdout
  --code=&lt;file&gt;           give quantum code for query sequence (only for display)
  --format=&lt;type&gt;         specify output format; one of lav, axt, maf, maf+, maf-, text,
                          lav+text, cigar, text, rdplot, general, or general:&lt;fields&gt;
                          (by default output is LAV)
  --rdotplot=&lt;file&gt;       create an additional output file suitable for plotting the alignments 
                          with the R statistical package.
  --markend               Just before normal completion, write "# lastz end-of-file" to output file
  --census[=&lt;output_file&gt;]    count and report how many times each target base aligns, up 
                          to 255. Ns are included in the count
  --census16[=&lt;output_file&gt;]  count and report how many times each target base aligns, up
                          up 65 thousand
  --census32[=&lt;output_file&gt;]  count and report how many times each target bas aligns, up
                          to 4 billion
  --writecapsule=&lt;capsule_file&gt;    just write out a targegt capsule file and quit; don't 
                          search for seeds or perform subsequent stages
  --verbosity=&lt;level&gt;     set info level (0 is minimum, 10 is everything)
                          (default is 0)
  --[no]runtime           report runtime in the output file
                          (default is to not report runtime)
  --tableonly[=count]     just produce the target position table, don't
                          search for seeds
  --[no]stats[=&lt;file&gt;]    show search statistics (or don't)
                          (not available in this build)
  --version               report the program version and quit
  --help                  list all options
  --help=files            list information about file specifiers
