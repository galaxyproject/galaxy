Datasets are partitioned according to the protocol below:

A partition scheme has been defined that is similar to what has previously been done with TARs/TRANSFRAGs such that any feature can be classified as falling into one of the following 6 categories:
  1. **Coding** -- coding exons defined from the GENCODE experimentally verified coding set (coding in any transcript)
  2. **5UTR** -- 5' UTR exons defined from the GENCODE experimentally verified coding set (5' UTR in some transcript but never coding in any other)
  3. **3UTR** -- 3' UTR exons defined from the GENCODE experimentally verified coding set (3' UTR in some transcript but never coding in any other)
  4. **Intronic Proximal** -- intronic and no more than 5kb away from an exon.
  5. **Intergenic Proximal** -- between genes and no more than 5kb away from an exon.
  6. **Intronic Distal** -- intronic and greater than 5kb away from an exon.
  7. **Intergenic Distal** -- between genes and greater than 5kb away from an exon.

**Note:** Features overlapping more than one partition will take the identity of the lower-numbered partition.
