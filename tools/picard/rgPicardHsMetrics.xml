**Picard Documentation**

Picard documentation says:


Calculates a set of Hybrid Selection specific metrics from an aligned SAM or BAM file.

   "Option", "Description"
   "BAIT_INTERVALS=File","An interval list file that contains the locations of the baits used. Required."

HsMetrics

 The set of metrics captured that are specific to a hybrid selection analysis.

Output Column Definitions

#. BAIT_SET: The name of the bait set used in the hybrid selection.
#. GENOME_SIZE: The number of bases in the reference genome used for alignment.
#. BAIT_TERRITORY: The number of bases which have one or more baits on top of them.
#. TARGET_TERRITORY: The unique number of target bases in the experiment where target is usually exons etc.
#. BAIT_DESIGN_EFFICIENCY: Target terrirtoy / bait territory. 1 == perfectly efficient, 0.5 = half of baited bases are not target.
#. TOTAL_READS: The total number of reads in the SAM or BAM file examine.
#. PF_READS: The number of reads that pass the vendor's filter.
#. PF_UNIQUE_READS: The number of PF reads that are not marked as duplicates.
#. PCT_PF_READS: PF reads / total reads. The percent of reads passing filter.
#. PCT_PF_UQ_READS: PF Unique Reads / Total Reads.
#. PF_UQ_READS_ALIGNED: The number of PF unique reads that are aligned with mapping score > 0 to the reference genome.
#. PCT_PF_UQ_READS_ALIGNED: PF Reads Aligned / PF Reads.
#. PF_UQ_BASES_ALIGNED: The number of bases in the PF aligned reads that are mapped to a reference base. Accounts for clipping and gaps.
#. ON_BAIT_BASES: The number of PF aligned bases that mapped to a baited region of the genome.
#. NEAR_BAIT_BASES: The number of PF aligned bases that mapped to within a fixed interval of a baited region, but not on a baited region.
#. OFF_BAIT_BASES: The number of PF aligned bases that mapped to neither on or near a bait.
#. ON_TARGET_BASES: The number of PF aligned bases that mapped to a targetted region of the genome.
#. PCT_SELECTED_BASES: On+Near Bait Bases / PF Bases Aligned.
#. PCT_OFF_BAIT: The percentage of aligned PF bases that mapped neither on or near a bait.
#. ON_BAIT_VS_SELECTED: The percentage of on+near bait bases that are on as opposed to near.
#. MEAN_BAIT_COVERAGE: The mean coverage of all baits in the experiment.
#. MEAN_TARGET_COVERAGE: The mean coverage of targets that recieved at least coverage depth = 2 at one base.
#. PCT_USABLE_BASES_ON_BAIT: The number of aligned, de-duped, on-bait bases out of the PF bases available.
#. PCT_USABLE_BASES_ON_TARGET: The number of aligned, de-duped, on-target bases out of the PF bases available.
#. FOLD_ENRICHMENT: The fold by which the baited region has been amplified above genomic background.
#. ZERO_CVG_TARGETS_PCT: The number of targets that did not reach coverage=2 over any base.
#. FOLD_80_BASE_PENALTY: The fold over-coverage necessary to raise 80% of bases in "non-zero-cvg" targets to the mean coverage level in those targets.
#. PCT_TARGET_BASES_2X: The percentage of ALL target bases acheiving 2X or greater coverage.
#. PCT_TARGET_BASES_10X: The percentage of ALL target bases acheiving 10X or greater coverage.
#. PCT_TARGET_BASES_20X: The percentage of ALL target bases acheiving 20X or greater coverage.
#. PCT_TARGET_BASES_30X: The percentage of ALL target bases acheiving 30X or greater coverage.
#. HS_LIBRARY_SIZE: The estimated number of unique molecules in the selected part of the library.
#. HS_PENALTY_10X: The "hybrid selection penalty" incurred to get 80% of target bases to 10X. This metric should be interpreted as: if I have a design with 10 megabases of target, and want to get 10X coverage I need to sequence until PF_ALIGNED_BASES = 10^6 * 10 * HS_PENALTY_10X.
#. HS_PENALTY_20X: The "hybrid selection penalty" incurred to get 80% of target bases to 20X. This metric should be interpreted as: if I have a design with 10 megabases of target, and want to get 20X coverage I need to sequence until PF_ALIGNED_BASES = 10^6 * 20 * HS_PENALTY_20X.
#. HS_PENALTY_30X: The "hybrid selection penalty" incurred to get 80% of target bases to 10X. This metric should be interpreted as: if I have a design with 10 megabases of target, and want to get 30X coverage I need to sequence until PF_ALIGNED_BASES = 10^6 * 30 * HS_PENALTY_30X.

*Typical tool invocation without Galaxy is on a command line - eg:*

java -jar /share/shared/galaxy/tool-data/shared/jars/CalculateHsMetrics.jar BAIT_INTERVALS=test.pic TARGET_INTERVALS=test.pic INPUT=test.bam
OUTPUT=picardHsMetrics.txt VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=LENIENT

Note that last parameter - your life will be far easier if you use it as some of the external packages that
Galaxy relies upon are capable of producing sam/bam
files that Picard will refuse to parse.

The lenient flag means reads are discarded if empty or off the end of the map - or whatever. Suggestions for
improvement are welcome.

**Attribution**

This tool takes interval files in the usual Galaxy interval (bed) format as bait and target sequences rather than
the special format Picard requires - the tool provides reliable reformatting for Picard.

Picard is a project associated with the SamTools project.
This Galaxy tool uses part of Picard to report measures of hybridization selection in your
aligned short read sequence data. Sequence data must be chosen from the sam/bam format files in your current history.
Target and bait files must be selected from the UCSC BED format in your current history.
