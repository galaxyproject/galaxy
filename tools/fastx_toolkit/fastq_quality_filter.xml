**What it does**

This tool filters reads based on quality scores.

.. class:: infomark

Using **percent = 100** requires all cycles of all reads to be at least the quality cut-off value.

.. class:: infomark

Using **percent = 50** requires the median quality of the cycles (in each read) to be at least the quality cut-off value.

--------

Quality score distribution (of all cycles) is calculated for each read. If it is lower than the quality cut-off value - the read is discarded.


**Example**::

    @CSHL_4_FC042AGOOII:1:2:214:584
    GACAATAAAC
    +CSHL_4_FC042AGOOII:1:2:214:584
    30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 20 10

Using **percent = 50** and **cut-off = 30** - This read will not be discarded (the median quality is higher than 30).

Using **percent = 90** and **cut-off = 30** - This read will be discarded (90% of the cycles do no have quality equal to / higher than 30).

Using **percent = 100** and **cut-off = 20** - This read will be discarded (not all cycles have quality equal to / higher than 20).
