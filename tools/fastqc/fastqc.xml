.. class:: infomark

**Purpose**

FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on raw
sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. 
It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick
impression of whether your data has any problems of 
which you should be aware before doing any further analysis.

The main functions of FastQC are:

- Import of data from BAM, SAM or FastQ files (any variant)
- Providing a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may be problems
- Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data
- Export of results to an HTML based permanent report
- Offline operation to allow automated generation of reports without running the interactive application

.. class:: infomark

**FastQC**

This is a Galaxy wrapper. It merely exposes the external package FastQC_ which is documented at FastQC_
Kindly acknowledge it as well as this tool if you use it.
FastQC incorporates the Picard-tools_ libraries for sam/bam processing.

The contaminants file parameter was borrowed from the independently developed
fastqcwrapper contributed to the Galaxy Community Tool Shed by J. Johnson.
Adaption to version 0.11.2 by T. McGowan.

**Inputs and outputs**

FastQC_ is the best place to look for documentation - it's very good. 
A summary follows below for those in a tearing hurry.

This wrapper will accept a Galaxy fastq, sam or bam as the input read file to check.
It will also take an optional file containing a list of contaminants information, in the form of
a tab-delimited file with 2 columns, name and sequence. As another option the tool takes a custom
limits.txt file that allows setting the warning thresholds for the different modules and also specifies
which modules to include in the output.

The tool produces a basic text and a HTML output file that contain all of the results, including the following:

- Basic Statistics
- Per base sequence quality
- Per sequence quality scores
- Per base sequence content
- Per base GC content
- Per sequence GC content
- Per base N content
- Sequence Length Distribution
- Sequence Duplication Levels
- Overrepresented sequences
- Kmer Content

All except Basic Statistics and Overrepresented sequences are plots.
