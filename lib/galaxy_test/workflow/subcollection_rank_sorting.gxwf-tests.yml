    Test to verify a tool that takes in a list or nested list is sent the most
    specific list possible during workflow execution (the nested list). This should
    not trigger subcollection mapping.
  job:
    input:
      type: collection
      collection_type: list:list
  outputs:
    out:
      asserts:
      - that: has_text
        text: "Nested List"

    Once again with mapping, should reduce the result into a flat list.
  job:
    input:
      type: collection
      collection_type: list:list:list
  outputs:
    out:
      class: Collection
      collection_type: list
      elements:
        test_level_2:
          asserts:
            - that: has_line
              line: "Nested List"
            - that: has_line
              line: "identifier is test_level_1"
