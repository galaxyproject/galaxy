"""Framework tests for checking workflow correctness and defining expected workflow behavior.

This is meant to grow into the workflow based mirror of what the framework tests are for tools.
api/test_workflows.py is still the place to test exceptional conditions, errors, etc... but tests
of normal operation where semantics can be verified with simple inputs and outputs can now be
placed in here.
