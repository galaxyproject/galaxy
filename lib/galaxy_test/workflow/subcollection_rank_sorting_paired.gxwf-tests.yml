    Test to verify a tool that takes in a paired or list of paired is sent the most
    specific list possible during workflow execution (the list of paired datasets). This should
    not trigger subcollection mapping.
  job:
    input:
      type: collection
      collection_type: list:paired
  outputs:
    out:
      asserts:
      - that: has_text
        text: "collection_type<paired>"

    Once again with mapping, should reduce the result into a flat list.
  job:
    input:
      type: collection
      collection_type: list:list:paired
  outputs:
    out:
      class: Collection
      collection_type: list
      elements:
        test_level_2:
          asserts:
            - that: has_text
              text: "identifier is test_level_1"
            - that: has_line
              line: "collection_type<paired>"

    Once again with double mapping, should reduce the result into a nested list (list:list).
  job:
    input:
      type: collection
      collection_type: list:list:list:paired
  outputs:
    out:
      class: Collection
      collection_type: list:list
      elements:
        test_level_3:
          elements:
            test_level_2:
              asserts:
                - that: has_text
                  text: "identifier is test_level_1"
                - that: has_line
                  line: "collection_type<paired>"
