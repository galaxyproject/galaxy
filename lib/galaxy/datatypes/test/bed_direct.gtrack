# GTrack subtype for BED data (linked version)
#
# Works directly with BED data [1]. Note that the GTrack format itself do not
# understand the division of segments into blocks, but GTrack parsers
# specialized for this GTrack subtype should understand it. It requires minor
# modifications for a BED parser to support this GTrack subtype. See [2] for
# more details on GTrack and the concepts of track types. The GTrack
# specification and GTrack subtypes and example files are found at [3].
#
# To use, add the following line to the beginning of your GTrack file (excluding
# the preceding '# ' characters):
#
# ##subtype url: gtrack.no/bed_direct.gtrack
