  #metadata_strategy: directory

  # Although it is fairly reliable, setting metadata can occasionally
  # fail.  In these instances, you can choose to retry setting it
  # internally or leave it in a failed state (since retrying internally

  # set to false, the user will be given the option to retry externally,
  # or set metadata manually (when possible).
  #retry_metadata_internally: true

  # Very large metadata values can cause Galaxy crashes.  This will
  # allow limiting the maximum metadata key size (in bytes used in

  # is 5MB, but as low as 1MB seems to be a reasonable size.
  #max_metadata_value_size: 5242880

  # This option will override tool output paths to write outputs to the
  # job working directory (instead of to the file_path) and the job
  # manager will move the outputs to their proper place in the dataset
  # directory on the Galaxy server after the job completes. This is
  # necessary (for example) if jobs run on a cluster and datasets can
  # not be created by the user running the jobs (e.g. if the filesystem
  # is mounted read-only or the jobs are run by a different user than
  # the galaxy user).
  #outputs_to_working_directory: false

  # If your network filesystem's caching prevents the Galaxy server from
  # seeing the job's stdout and stderr files when it completes, you can
  # retry reading these files.  The job runner will retry the number of
  # times specified below, waiting 1 second between tries.  For NFS, you
  # may want to try the -noac mount option (Linux) or -actimeo=0

  # submitted job. Note that ``remote`` is a beta setting that will be

  # In the past Galaxy would preserve its Python environment when
  # running jobs ( and still does for internal tools packaged with
  # Galaxy). This behavior exposes Galaxy internals to tools and could
  # result in problems when activating Python environments for tools
  # (such as with Conda packaging). The default legacy_only will
  # restrict this behavior to tools identified by the Galaxy team as
  # requiring this environment. Set this to "always" to restore the
  # previous behavior (and potentially break Conda dependency resolution
  # for many tools). Set this to legacy_and_local to preserve the
