### Sample Object Store configuration file
###

# There should only be one root object store, multiple are shown here to show different configuration options. Any
# object store can be used as backends to the distributed and hierarchical object stores (including distributed and
# hierarchical themselves).

# Most non-disk object store types have a `cache` option like:
#
# cache:
#   # local path to store cached data,
#   path: "database/object_store_cache"
#   # size of the cache in gigabytes
#   size: 1000
#   # optional parameter that allows to control data is being sent directly to an object store without storing it in the
#   # cache. By default (true) data is also copied to the cache.
#   cache_updated_data: true
#
# Most object store types have a `store_by` option which can be set to either `uuid` or `id`. Older Galaxy servers
# stored datasets by their numeric id (000/dataset_1.dat, 00/dataset_2.dat, ...), whereas newer Galaxy servers store
# them by UUID (b/5/e/dataset_b5e0301c-4c2e-41ac-b2c1-3c243f91b6ec.dat, ...). Storing by UUID is preferred, storing by
# ID should only be used for preexisting store-by-id backends.

#
# Sample Disk Object Store configuration
#

# This mirrors the default configuration if there is no object store configuration file. The default uses the values of
# file_path, new_file_path, and job_working_directory in galaxy.yml.

type: disk
store_by: uuid
files_dir: database/objects
extra_dirs:
  - type: job_work
    path: database/jobs_directory


#
# Sample Hierarchical Object Store with disk backends configuration
#

# In the hierarchical object store, existing datasets will be searched for in backends in the order of the list of
# specified backends, until the dataset is found. New datasets are always created in the first backend in the list.

type: hierarchical
backends:
  - type: disk
    store_by: uuid

    extra_dirs:
      - type: job_work
        path: /new-fs/galaxy/jobs
  - type: disk
    store_by: id
    files_dir: /old-fs/galaxy/files

#
# Sample Distributed Object Store with disk backends configuration
#

# In the distributed object store, existing datasets will be located by the `object_store_id` column in the `dataset`
# table of the Galaxy database, which corresponds to the `id` option on the backend. New datasets are created based on
# the `weight` option: a backend with weight "2" has twice the chance of being (randomly) selected for new datasets as a
# backend with weight "1". A weight of "0" will still allow datasets in that backend to be read, but no new datasets
# will be written to that backend.
#
# In distributed and hierarchical configurations, you can choose that some backends are automatically unused whenever
# they become too full. Setting the `global_max_percent_full` option on the top level backends config enables this, or
# it can be applied to individual backends with `max_percent_full` to override the global setting. This only applies to
# disk based backends and not remote object stores.
#
# By default, if a dataset should exist but its object_store_id is null, all backends will be searched until it is
# found. This is to aid in Galaxy servers moving from non-distributed to distributed object stores, but this behavior
# can be disabled by setting `search_for_missing` to "false" on the top level backends config.

global_max_percent_full: 90

    files_dir: /old-fs/galaxy/files

#
# Sample Nested (Distributed in Hierarchical) Object Store configuration
#

# These object stores support nesting object stores inside object stores. In this example, new data are created in the
# distributed object store, but old data will be searched for in a disk object store. This is useful if moving from
# non-distributed to distributed since you don't have to set `object_store_id` for old data in the database.
#
# In this example, new dataset creation is distributed evenly between two backends.

# There are now four ways to access S3 related services. Two are
# suitable just for AWS services (aws_s3 & cloud), one is
# more suited for non-AWS S3 compatible services (generic_s3),
# and finally boto3 gracefully handles either scenario.
# 
# boto3 is built on the newest and most widely used Python client
# outside of Galaxy. It has advanced transfer options and is likely
# the client you should use for new setup. generic_s3 and aws_s3
# have existed in Galaxy for longer and could perhaps be considered
# more battle tested. Both boto3 and generic_s3 have been tested
# with multiple non-AWS APIs including minio and GCP. The cloud
# implementation is based on CloudBridge and is still supported
# and has been recently tested - the downside is mostly the advanced
# multi-threaded processing options of boto3 are not available
# and it has not been battle tested like aws_s3.

# Sample User-Selectable Scratch Storage configuration
#

# This distributed object store will default to a normal path on disk using the default quota but sets up a second path
# with user-private storage a larger quota and warns the user the disk is routinely cleaned. Relative speed and
# stability differences are communicated to the user using object store badges - as well as how data is backed up (in
# the default case) and not backed up for scratch storage.
#
# The admin is responsible for routinely cleaning that storage using Galaxy's admin scripts - this object store
# configuration just allows the user selection and communicates expectations to the user. Training related to Galaxy
# cleanup scripts can be found in the Galaxy Training Network:
#
# Slides: https://gxy.io/GTN:S00103
# Tutorial: https://gxy.io/GTN:T00324
#
# In this example, the scratch storage is marked as user-private by setting the `private` option to "true" on the
# backend definition. This means it cannot be used in public datasets, shared between users, etc.. This is for example
# purposes - you may very well not want scratch storage to be defined as private as it prevents a lot of regular
# functionality and Galaxy handles regularly cleaned datasets fairly gracefully when the appropriate admin scripts are
# used.
#
# It is safe to just relabel the object store that a dataset belongs to if the underlying paths mapped to by the object
# stores are the same and the dataset has not been copied. To enable users to relocate datasets this way set the
# backends' `device` property to the same value.

      Much of the data analysis conducted on MSI’s high-performance computing resources uses data gathered from UMN
      shared research facilities (SRFs). In recognition of the need for short to medium term storage for this data, MSI
      provides a service, Shared User Research Facilities Storage (SURFS), enabling SRFs to deliver data directly to MSI
      users. By providing a designated location for this data, MSI can focus data backup and other processes to these
      key datasets.  As part of this service, MSI will provide the storage of the data for one year from its delivery
      date.

      It's expected that the consumers of these data sets will be responsible for discerning which data they may wish to
      keep past the 1-year term, and finding an appropriate place to keep it. There are several possible storage options
      both at MSI and the wider university. You can explore your options using OIT’s digital [storage options chooser
