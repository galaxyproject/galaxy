Use this template to customize the text email your users will receive
when a new notification of category "new_shared_item" is sent to them.
Copy the file to {{ templates_dir }}/mail/notifications/new_shared_item-email.txt and modify as required.

If you are adding URLs, remember that only absolute URLs (with
a domain name) make sense in email! They can be served from any stable
location, including your Galaxy server or GitHub.

The following variables are available for inserting into the text like

sent:

- hostname                  Your galaxy's hostname (i.e. usegalaxy.* or the value in `server_name` from the galaxy config file)
- contact_email             Your galaxy's contact email
- notification_settings_url The URL to the user's notification settings to manage their subscriptions
- variant                   The notification variant indicates the level of importance of the notification (i.e. info, warning, urgent)
- content                   The new_shared_item payload
  - item_type               The type of the shared item
  - item_name               The name of the shared item
  - owner_name              The name of the owner of the shared item
  - slug                    The slug of the shared item. Used for the link to the item.
- galaxy_url                The URL to the Galaxy instance (i.e. https://usegalaxy.*)
