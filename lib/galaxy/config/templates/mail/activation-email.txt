Use this template to customise the "account activation" text email your
users will receive. Copy the file to
{{ templates_dir }}/mail/activation-email.txt and modify as required.

If you are adding URLs into this, remember that only absolute URLS (with
a domain name) make sense in email! They can be served from any stable
location, including your Galaxy server or GitHub.

The following variables are available for inserting into the text like
{{ variable_name }}. They will be rendered into the text before the email is
sent:

- name                     The user's name
- user_email               The user's email
- date                     Date of registration
- hostname                 Your galaxy's hostname
- activation_url           The account activation URL
- terms_url                Your T&Cs URL
- contact_email            Your galaxy's contact email
- instance_resource_url    Your galaxy's resource website URL
- custom_message           Your Galaxy config custom_activation_email_message
- expiry_days              Days until the activation link expires
