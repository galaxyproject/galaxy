  Galaxy is configured by default to be usable in a single-user development
  environment.  To tune the application for a multi-user production
  environment, see the documentation at:

   https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/production.html

  Throughout this sample configuration file, except where stated otherwise,
  uncommented values override the default if left unset, whereas commented
  values are set to the default value.  Relative paths are relative to the root
  Galaxy directory.

  Examples of many of these options are explained in more detail in the Galaxy
  Community Hub.

    https://galaxyproject.org/admin/config

  Config hackers are encouraged to check there before asking for help.
mapping:

    required: true
    mapping:

      config_dir:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          The directory that will be prepended to relative paths in options specifying
          other Galaxy config files (e.g. datatypes_config_file). Defaults to the
          directory in which galaxy.yml is located.

      managed_config_dir:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          The directory that will be prepended to relative paths in options specifying
          config files controlled by Galaxy (such as shed_tool_config_file, etc.). Must be
          writable by the user running Galaxy.  Defaults to `<config_dir>/` if running
          Galaxy from source or `<data_dir>/config` otherwise.

      data_dir:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          The directory that will be prepended to relative paths in options specifying
          Galaxy data/cache directories and files (such as the default SQLite database,
          file_path, etc.). Defaults to `database/` if running Galaxy from source or
          `<config_dir>/data` otherwise.

      templates_dir:
        type: str
        path_resolves_to: config_dir
        required: false
        default: templates
        desc: |
          The directory containing custom templates for Galaxy, such as HTML/text email templates. Defaults to 'templates'. Default templates can be found in the Galaxy root under config/templates. These can be copied to <templates_dir> if you wish to customize them.

      cache_dir:
        type: str
        default: cache
        path_resolves_to: data_dir
        required: false
        desc: |
          Top level cache directory. Any other cache directories
          (template_cache_path, etc.) should be subdirectories.

      database_connection:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          By default, Galaxy uses a SQLite database at '<data_dir>/universe.sqlite'. You
          may use a SQLAlchemy connection string to specify an external database instead.

          Sample default 'sqlite:///<data_dir>/universe.sqlite?isolation_level=IMMEDIATE'

          You may specify additional options that will be passed to the SQLAlchemy
          database engine by using the prefix "database_engine_option_". For some of these
          options, default values are provided (e.g. see database_engine_option_pool_size,
          etc.).

          The same applies to `install_database_connection`, for which you should use the
          "install_database_engine_option_" prefix.

          For more options, please check SQLAlchemy's documentation at
          https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/engines.html?highlight=create_engine#sqlalchemy.create_engine

      database_engine_option_pool_size:
        type: int
        default: 5
        required: false
        desc: |
          If the server logs errors about not having enough database pool connections,
          you will want to increase these values, or consider running more Galaxy
          processes.

      database_engine_option_max_overflow:
        type: int
        default: 10
        required: false
        desc: |
          If the server logs errors about not having enough database pool connections,
          you will want to increase these values, or consider running more Galaxy
          processes.

      database_engine_option_pool_recycle:
        type: int
        default: -1
        required: false
        desc: |
          If using MySQL and the server logs the error "MySQL server has gone away",
          you will want to set this to some positive value (7200 should work).

      database_engine_option_server_side_cursors:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          If large database query results are causing memory or response time issues in
          the Galaxy process, leave the result on the server instead.  This option is
          only available for PostgreSQL and is highly recommended.

      database_query_profiling_proxy:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Log all database transactions, can be useful for debugging and performance
          profiling.  Logging is done via Python's 'logging' module under the qualname
          'galaxy.model.orm.logging_connection_proxy'

      database_template:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          If auto-creating a postgres database on startup - it can be based on an existing
          template database. This will set that. This is probably only useful for testing but
          documentation is included here for completeness.

      database_log_query_counts:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Log number of SQL queries executed and total time spent dispatching SQL statements for
          each web request. If statsd is also enabled this information will be logged there as well.
          This should be considered somewhat experimental, we are unsure of the performance costs of
          running this in production. This is useful information for optimizing database interaction
          performance. Similar information can be obtained on a per-request basis by enabling the
          sql_debug middleware and adding sql_debug=1 to a request string.

      slow_query_log_threshold:
        type: float
        default: 0.0
        required: false
        desc: |
          Slow query logging.  Queries slower than the threshold indicated below will
          be logged to debug.  A value of '0' is disabled.  For example, you would set
          this to .005 to log all queries taking longer than 5 milliseconds.

      enable_per_request_sql_debugging:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Enables a per request sql debugging option. If this is set to true,
          append ?sql_debug=1 to web request URLs to enable detailed logging on
          the backend of SQL queries generated during that request. This is
          useful for debugging slow endpoints during development.

      install_database_connection:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          By default, Galaxy will use the same database to track user data and
          tool shed install data.  There are many situations in which it is
          valuable to separate these - for instance bootstrapping fresh Galaxy
          instances with pretested installs.  The following option can be used to
          separate the tool shed install database (all other options listed above
          but prefixed with ``install_`` are also available).

          Defaults to the value of the 'database_connection' option.

      database_auto_migrate:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Setting the following option to true will cause Galaxy to automatically
          migrate the database forward after updates. This is not recommended for production
          use.

      database_wait:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Wait for database to become available instead of failing immediately.

      database_wait_attempts:
        type: int
        default: 60
        required: false
        desc: |
          Number of attempts before failing if database_wait is enabled.

      database_wait_sleep:
        type: float
        default: 1.
        required: false
        desc: |
          Time to sleep between attempts if database_wait is enabled (in seconds).

      history_audit_table_prune_interval:
        type: int
        default: 3600
        required: false
        desc: |
          Time (in seconds) between attempts to remove old rows from the history_audit database table.
          Set to 0 to disable pruning.

      file_path:
        type: str
        default: objects
        path_resolves_to: data_dir
        required: false
        desc: |
          Where dataset files are stored. It must be accessible at the same path on any cluster
          nodes that will run Galaxy jobs, unless using Pulsar. The default value has been changed
          from 'files' to 'objects' as of 20.05; however, Galaxy will first check if the 'files'
          directory exists before using 'objects' as the default.

      new_file_path:
        type: str
        default: tmp
        path_resolves_to: data_dir
        required: false
        desc: |
          Where temporary files are stored. It must be accessible at the same path on any cluster
          nodes that will run Galaxy jobs, unless using Pulsar.

      maximum_upload_file_size:
        type: int
        default: 107374182400
        required: false
        desc: |
          Maximum size of uploadable files, specified in bytes (default: 100GB).
          This value is ignored if an external upload server is configured.

      tool_config_file:
        type: any
        default: tool_conf.xml
        path_resolves_to: config_dir
        required: false
        desc: |
          Tool config files, defines what tools are available in Galaxy.
          Tools can be locally developed or installed from Galaxy tool sheds.
          (config/tool_conf.xml.sample will be used if left unset and
          config/tool_conf.xml does not exist). Can be a single file, a list of
          files, or (for backwards compatibility) a comma-separated list of files.

      shed_tool_config_file:
        type: str
        default: shed_tool_conf.xml
        path_resolves_to: managed_config_dir
        required: false
        desc: |
          Tool config file for tools installed from the Galaxy Tool Shed. Must
          be writable by Galaxy and generally should not be edited by hand. In
          older Galaxy releases, this file was part of the tool_config_file
          option. It is still possible to specify this file (and other
          shed-enabled tool config files) in tool_config_file, but in the
          standard case of a single shed-enabled tool config, this option is
          preferable. This file will be created automatically upon tool
          installation, whereas Galaxy will fail to start if any files in
          tool_config_file cannot be read.

      migrated_tools_config:
        type: str
        default: migrated_tools_conf.xml
        path_resolves_to: managed_config_dir
        required: false
        desc: |
          This option is deprecated.
          In previous releases this file was maintained by tool migration scripts that are no
          longer part of the code base. The option remains as a placeholder for deployments where
          these scripts were previously run and such a file exists.

      integrated_tool_panel_config:
        type: str
        default: integrated_tool_panel.xml
        required: false
        desc: |
          File that contains the XML section and tool tags from all tool panel config
          files integrated into a single file that defines the tool panel layout.  This
          file can be changed by the Galaxy administrator to alter the layout of the
          tool panel.  If not present, Galaxy will create it.

          The value of this option will be resolved with respect to <managed_config_dir>.

      tool_path:
        type: str
        default: tools
        required: false
        desc: |
          Default path to the directory containing the tools defined in tool_conf.xml.
          Other tool config files must include the tool_path as an attribute in the
          <toolbox> tag.

      tool_dependency_dir:
        type: str
        default: dependencies
        path_resolves_to: data_dir
        required: false
        desc: |
          Various dependency resolver configuration parameters will have defaults set relative
          to this path, such as the default conda prefix, default Galaxy packages path, legacy
          tool shed dependencies path, and the dependency cache directory.

          Set the string to null to explicitly disable tool dependency handling.
          If this option is set to none or an invalid path, installing tools with dependencies
          from the Tool Shed or in Conda will fail.

      dependency_resolvers_config_file:
        type: str
        default: dependency_resolvers_conf.xml
        path_resolves_to: config_dir
        required: false
        desc: |
          Specifies the path to the standalone dependency resolvers configuration file. This
          configuration can now be specified directly in the Galaxy configuration, see the
          description of the 'dependency_resolvers' option for details.

      conda_prefix:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          conda_prefix is the location on the filesystem where Conda packages and environments are
          installed.

          Sample default '<tool_dependency_dir>/_conda'

      conda_exec:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          Override the Conda executable to use, it will default to the one on the
          PATH (if available) and then to <conda_prefix>/bin/conda

      conda_debug:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Pass debug flag to conda commands.

      conda_ensure_channels:
        type: str
        default: conda-forge,bioconda
        required: false
        desc: |
          conda channels to enable by default
          (https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-channels.html)

      conda_use_local:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Use locally-built conda packages.

      conda_auto_install:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Set to true to instruct Galaxy to look for and install missing tool
          dependencies before each job runs.

      conda_auto_init:
        type: bool
        required: false
        desc: |
          Set to true to instruct Galaxy to install Conda from the web automatically
          if it cannot find a local copy and conda_exec is not configured. The default is
          true if running Galaxy from source, and false if running from installed packages.

      conda_copy_dependencies:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          You must set this to true if conda_prefix and job_working_directory are not on the same
          volume, or some conda dependencies will fail to execute at job runtime.
          Conda will copy packages content instead of creating hardlinks or symlinks.
          This will prevent problems with some specific packages (perl, R), at the cost
          of extra disk space usage and extra time spent copying packages.

      local_conda_mapping_file:
        type: str
        default: 'local_conda_mapping.yml'
        path_resolves_to: config_dir
        required: false
        desc: |
          Path to a file that provides a mapping from abstract packages to concrete conda packages.
          See `config/local_conda_mapping.yml.sample` for examples.

      modules_mapping_files:
        type: str
        default: 'environment_modules_mapping.yml'
        path_resolves_to: config_dir
        required: false
        desc: |
          Path to a file that provides a mapping from abstract packages to locally installed modules.
          See `config/environment_modules_mapping.yml.sample` for examples.

      use_cached_dependency_manager:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Certain dependency resolvers (namely Conda) take a considerable amount of
          time to build an isolated job environment in the job_working_directory if the
          job working directory is on a network share.  Set this option to true
          to cache the dependencies in a folder. This option is beta and should only be
          used if you experience long waiting times before a job is actually submitted
          to your cluster.

          This only affects tools where some requirements can be resolved but not others,
          most modern best practice tools can use prebuilt environments in the Conda
          directory.

      tool_dependency_cache_dir:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          By default the tool_dependency_cache_dir is the _cache directory
          of the tool dependency directory.

          Sample default '<tool_dependency_dir>/_cache'

      precache_dependencies:
        type: bool
        default: true
        required: false
        desc: |
          By default, when using a cached dependency manager, the dependencies are cached
          when installing new tools and when using tools for the first time.
          Set this to false if you prefer dependencies to be cached only when installing new tools.

      tool_sheds_config_file:
        type: str
        default: tool_sheds_conf.xml
        path_resolves_to: config_dir
        required: false
        desc: |
          File containing the Galaxy Tool Sheds that should be made available to
          install from in the admin interface (.sample used if default does not exist).

      watch_tools:
        type: str
        default: 'false'
        required: false
        desc: |
          Monitor the tools and tool directories listed in any tool config file specified in
          tool_config_file option.  If changes are found, tools are automatically reloaded.
          Watchdog ( https://pypi.org/project/watchdog/ ) must be installed and available to Galaxy
          to use this option. Other options include 'auto' which will attempt to watch tools if the
          watchdog library is available but won't fail to load Galaxy if it is not and 'polling'
          which will use a less efficient monitoring scheme that may work in wider range of
          scenarios than the watchdog default.

      watch_job_rules:
        type: str
        default: 'false'
        required: false
        desc: |
          Monitor dynamic job rules. If changes are found, rules are automatically reloaded. Takes
          the same values as the 'watch_tools' option.

      watch_core_config:
        type: str
        default: 'false'
        required: false
        desc: |
          Monitor a subset of options in the core configuration file (See RELOADABLE_CONFIG_OPTIONS
          in lib/galaxy/config/__init__.py).  If changes are found, modified options are
          automatically reloaded. Takes the same values as the 'watch_tools' option.

      watch_tours:
        type: str
        default: 'false'
        required: false
        desc: |
          Monitor the interactive tours directory specified in the 'tour_config_dir' option. If
          changes are found, modified tours are automatically reloaded. Takes the same values as the
          'watch_tools' option.

      short_term_storage_dir:
        type: str
        default: short_term_web_storage
        path_resolves_to: cache_dir
        required: false
        desc: |
          Location of files available for a short time as downloads (short term storage).
          This directory is exclusively used for serving dynamically generated downloadable
          content. Galaxy may uses the new_file_path parameter as a general temporary directory
          and that directory should be monitored by a tool such as tmpwatch in production
          environments. short_term_storage_dir on the other hand is monitored by Galaxy's task
          framework and should not require such external tooling.

      short_term_storage_default_duration:
        type: int
        required: false
        default: 86400
        desc: |
          Default duration before short term web storage files will be cleaned up by Galaxy
          tasks (in seconds). The default duration is 1 day.

      short_term_storage_maximum_duration:
        type: int
        required: false
        default: 0
        desc: |
          The maximum duration short term storage files can hosted before they will be marked for
          clean up.  The default setting of 0 indicates no limit here.

          User defined object stores and file sources are saved in the database with
          their last valid configuration. It may be the case that the admin changes
          file source and object store templates over time such that the variables
          and secrets an instance is saved with no longer match the configuration's
          expected values. For this reason, admins should always add new versions of
          templates instead of just changing them - however people take shortcuts and
          divergences might happen. If a template is changed in such a way it breaks
          or if a template disappears from the library of templates this parameter controls
          how and if the database version will be used.

          By default, it will simply be used as a 'fallback' if a configuration cannot
          be resolved against the template version in the configuration file. Using 'preferred'
          instead will mean the stored database version is always used. This ensures a greater
          degree of reproducibility without effort on the part of the admin but also means
          that small issues are not easy to fix. Using 'never' instead will ensure the
          config templates are always only loaded from the template library files - this
          might make sense for admins who want to disable templates without worrying about
          the contents of the database.

          Rather than specifying an object_store_config_file, the object store configuration can be embedded into
          Galaxy's config with this option.

          This option has no effect if the file specified by object_store_config_file exists. Otherwise, if this option
          is set, it overrides any other objectstore settings.

          The syntax, available storage plugins, and documentation of their options is explained in detail in the
          object store sample configuration file, `object_store_conf.sample.yml`

        desc: |
          Specify where cache monitoring is driven for caching object stores
          such as S3, Azure, and iRODS. This option has no affect on disk object stores.
          For production instances, the cache should be monitored by external tools such
          as tmpwatch and this value should be set to 'external'. This will disable all
          cache monitoring in Galaxy. Alternatively, 'celery' can monitor caches using
          a periodic task or an 'inprocess' thread can be used - but this last option
          seriously limits Galaxy's ability to scale. The default of 'auto' will use
          'celery' if 'enable_celery_tasks' is set to true or 'inprocess' otherwise.
          This option serves as the default for all object stores and can be overridden
          on a per object store basis (but don't - just setup tmpwatch for all relevant
          cache paths).

        desc: |
          For object store cache monitoring done by Galaxy, this is the interval between
          cache checking steps. This is used by both inprocess cache monitors (which we
          recommend you do not use) and by the celery task if it is configured (by setting
          enable_celery_tasks to true and not setting object_store_cache_monitor_driver to
          external).

        desc: |
          Set this to true to indicate in the UI that a user's object store selection
          isn't simply a "preference" that job destinations often respect but in fact
          will always be respected. This should be set to true to simplify the UI as
          long as job destinations never override 'object_store_id's for a jobs.

        desc: |
          What Dataset attribute is used to reference files in an ObjectStore implementation,
          this can be 'uuid' or 'id'. The default will depend on how the object store is configured,
          starting with 20.05 Galaxy will try to default to 'uuid' if it can be sure this
          is a new Galaxy instance - but the default will be 'id' in many cases. In particular,
          if the name of the directory set in <file_path> is `objects`, the default will be set
          to 'uuid', otherwise it will be 'id'.

      smtp_server:

          Galaxy sends mail for various things: subscribing users to the mailing list
          if they request it, password resets, reporting dataset errors, and sending
          activation emails. To do this, it needs to send mail through an SMTP server,
          which you may define here (host:port).
          Galaxy will automatically try STARTTLS but will continue upon failure.

      smtp_username:

          Datasets in an error state include a link to report the error.  Those reports
          will be sent to this address.  Error reports are disabled if no address is
          set.  Also this email is shown as a contact to user in case of Galaxy
          misconfiguration and other events user may encounter.

      email_from:
        type: str
        required: false

          Email address to use in the 'From' field when sending emails for
          account activations, workflow step notifications, password resets, and
          tool error reports.  We recommend using a string in the following format:
          Galaxy Project <galaxy-no-reply@example.com>.
          If not configured, '<galaxy-no-reply@HOSTNAME>' will be used.

      custom_activation_email_message:

        desc: |
          E-mail domains blocklist is used for filtering out users that are using
          disposable email addresses at registration.  If their address's base domain
          matches any domain on the list, they are refused registration. Address subdomains
          are ignored (both 'name@spam.com' and 'name@foo.spam.com' will match 'spam.com').

          Example value 'email_blocklist.conf'

          The value of this option will be resolved with respect to <config_dir>.

      email_domain_allowlist_file:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          E-mail domains allowlist is used to specify allowed email address domains.
          If the list is non-empty and a user attempts registration using an email
          address belonging to a domain that is not on the list, registration will be
          denied. Unlike <email_domain_allowlist_file> which matches the address's
          base domain, here email addresses are matched against the full domain (base + subdomain).
          This is a more restrictive option than <email_domain_blocklist_file>, and
          therefore, in case <email_domain_allowlist_file> is set and is not empty,
          <email_domain_blocklist_file> will be ignored.

          Example value 'email_allowlist.conf'

          The value of this option will be resolved with respect to <config_dir>.

          E-mail ban file is used to specify email addresses that have been banned.
          If a user attempts to register a new account using an email address listed in this file,
          registration will be denied. This file does not affect user sign-in. Email addresses are
          matched against a canonical address representation based on rules defined in <canonical_email_rules>.
          The file should include one email address per line. Lines starting with the "#" character are ignored.

          Galaxy can display data at various external browsers.  These options specify
          which browsers should be available.  URLs and builds available at these
          browsers are defined in the specified files.

          If use_remote_user is set to true, display application servers will be denied access
          to Galaxy and so displaying datasets in these sites will fail.
          display_servers contains a list of hostnames which should be allowed to
          bypass security to display datasets.  Please be aware that there are security
          implications if this is allowed.  More details (including required changes to
          the proxy server config) are available in the Apache proxy documentation on
          the Galaxy Community Hub.

          The list of servers in this sample config are for the UCSC Main, Test and
          Archaea browsers, but the default if left commented is to not allow any

          applications that have been defined for many of the datatypes that have the
          old-style.
          There is also a potential security concern with the old-style applications,
          where a malicious party could provide a link that appears to reference the
          Galaxy server, but contains a redirect to a third-party server, tricking a

        required: false
        desc: |
          The estimated geographical location of the server hosting your galaxy instance given as an ISO 3166 code.
          This is used to make carbon emissions estimates more accurate as the location effects the
          carbon intensity values used in the estimate calculation. This defaults to "GLOBAL" if not set or the
          `geographical_server_location_code` value is invalid or unsupported. To see a full list of supported locations,

        path_resolves_to: data_dir
        desc: |
          Map for the interactivetool proxy. Mappings are stored in a SQLite database file
          located on this path. As an alternative, you may also store them in any other RDBMS
          supported by SQLAlchemy using the option ``interactivetoolsproxy_map``, which
          overrides this one.

      interactivetoolsproxy_map:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          Use a database supported by SQLAlchemy as map for the interactivetool proxy.
          When this option is set, the value of ``interactivetools_map`` is ignored. The
          value of this option must be a
          `SQLAlchemy database URL <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html#database-urls>`_.
          Mappings are written to the table "gxitproxy" within the database. This value cannot match

        required: false
        desc: |
          Galaxy Interactive Tools (GxITs) can be stopped from within the Galaxy
          interface, killing the GxIT job without completing its metadata setting post-job
          steps. In such a case it may be desirable to set metadata on job outputs
          internally (in the Galaxy job handler process). The default is is the value of
          `retry_metadata_internally`, which defaults to `true`.

        desc: |
          If the above URL cannot be determined ahead of time in dynamic environments
          but the port which should be used to access Galaxy can be - this should be
          set to prevent Galaxy from having to guess.  For example if Galaxy is sitting
          behind a proxy with REMOTE_USER enabled - infrastructure shouldn't talk to
          Python processes directly and this should be set to 80 or 443, etc... If
          unset this file will be read for a server block defining a port corresponding
          to the webapp.

      nginx_x_accel_redirect_base:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          The same download handling can be done by nginx using X-Accel-Redirect.  This

        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          If using compression in the upstream proxy server, use this option to disable
          gzipping of dataset collection and library archives, since the upstream server
          will do it faster on the fly. To enable compression add ``application/zip``
          to the proxy's compressable mimetypes.

      upstream_mod_zip:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          If using the mod-zip module in nginx, use this option to assemble
          zip archives in nginx. This is preferable over the upstream_gzip option
          as Galaxy does not need to serve the archive.
          Requires setting up internal nginx locations to all paths that can be archived.
          See https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/nginx.html#creating-archives-with-mod-zip

        desc: |
          The following default adds a header to web request responses that
          will cause modern web browsers to not allow Galaxy to be embedded in
          the frames of web applications hosted at other hosts - this can help
          prevent a class of attack called clickjacking
          (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking).  If you configure a
          proxy in front of Galaxy - please ensure this header remains intact
          to protect your users.  Uncomment and leave empty to not set the
          `X-Frame-Options` header.

      nginx_upload_store:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          nginx can also handle file uploads (user-to-Galaxy) via nginx_upload_module.
          Configuration for this is complex and explained in detail in the
          documentation linked above.  The upload store is a temporary directory in
          which files uploaded by the upload module will be placed.

      nginx_upload_path:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          This value overrides the action set on the file upload form, e.g. the web
          path where the nginx_upload_module has been configured to intercept upload
          requests.

      nginx_upload_job_files_store:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          Galaxy can also use nginx_upload_module to receive files staged out upon job
          completion by remote job runners (i.e. Pulsar) that initiate staging
          operations on the remote end.  See the Galaxy nginx documentation for the
          corresponding nginx configuration.

      nginx_upload_job_files_path:
        type: str

        desc: |
          The upload store is a temporary directory in which files uploaded by the
          tus middleware or server for user uploads will be placed.
          Defaults to new_file_path if not set.

      tus_upload_store_job_files:
        type: str
        required: False
        desc: |
          The upload store is a temporary directory in which files uploaded by the

        required: false
        desc: |
          Galaxy can upload user files in chunks without using nginx. Enable the chunk
          uploader by specifying a chunk size larger than 0. The chunk size is specified
          in bytes (default: 10MB).

        required: false
        desc: |
          Have Galaxy manage dynamic proxy component for routing requests to other
          services based on Galaxy's session cookie.  It will attempt to do this by
          default though you do need to install node+npm and do an npm install from
          `lib/galaxy/web/proxy/js`.  It is generally more robust to configure this
          externally, managing it in the same way Galaxy itself is managed.  If true, Galaxy will only
          launch the proxy if it is actually going to be used (e.g. for Jupyter).

      dynamic_proxy:
        type: str
        default: node
        required: false
        desc: |
          As of 16.04 Galaxy supports multiple proxy types. The original NodeJS
          implementation, alongside a new Golang single-binary-no-dependencies
          version. Valid values are (node, golang)

      dynamic_proxy_session_map:

        default: session_map.sqlite
        path_resolves_to: data_dir
        required: false
        desc: |
          The NodeJS dynamic proxy can use an SQLite database or a JSON file for IPC,
          set that here.

      dynamic_proxy_bind_port:
        type: int
        default: 8800
        required: false
        desc: |
          Set the port and IP for the dynamic proxy to bind to, this must match
          the external configuration if dynamic_proxy_manage is set to false.

      dynamic_proxy_bind_ip:
        type: str
        default: 0.0.0.0
        required: false
        desc: |
          Set the port and IP for the dynamic proxy to bind to, this must match
          the external configuration if dynamic_proxy_manage is set to false.

      dynamic_proxy_debug:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Enable verbose debugging of Galaxy-managed dynamic proxy.

      dynamic_proxy_external_proxy:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          The dynamic proxy is proxied by an external proxy (e.g. apache frontend to
          nodejs to wrap connections in SSL).

      dynamic_proxy_prefix:
        type: str
        default: gie_proxy
        required: false
        desc: |
          Additionally, when the dynamic proxy is proxied by an upstream server, you'll
          want to specify a prefixed URL so both Galaxy and the proxy reside under the
          same path that your cookies are under. This will result in a url like
          https://FQDN/galaxy-prefix/gie_proxy for proxying

      dynamic_proxy_golang_noaccess:
        type: int
        default: 60
        required: false
        desc: |
          This attribute governs the minimum length of time between consecutive HTTP/WS
          requests through the proxy, before the proxy considers a container as being
          inactive and kills it.

      dynamic_proxy_golang_clean_interval:
        type: int
        default: 10
        required: false
        desc: |
          In order to kill containers, the golang proxy has to check at some interval
          for possibly dead containers. This is exposed as a configurable parameter,
          but the default value is probably fine.

      dynamic_proxy_golang_docker_address:
        type: str
        default: unix:///var/run/docker.sock
        required: false
        desc: |
          The golang proxy needs to know how to talk to your docker daemon. Currently
          TLS is not supported, that will come in an update.

      dynamic_proxy_golang_api_key:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          The golang proxy uses a RESTful HTTP API for communication with Galaxy
          instead of a JSON or SQLite file for IPC. If you do not specify this, it will
          be set randomly for you. You should set this if you are managing the proxy
          manually.

      auto_configure_logging:
        type: bool
        default: true
        required: false
        desc: |
          If true, Galaxy will attempt to configure a simple root logger if a
          "loggers" section does not appear in this configuration file.

      log_destination:
        type: str
        default: stdout
        required: false
        desc: |
          Log destination, defaults to special value "stdout" that logs to standard output. If set to anything else,
          then it will be interpreted as a path that will be used as the log file, and logging to stdout will be
          disabled.

      log_rotate_size:
        type: str
        default: "0"
        required: false
        desc: |
          Size of log file at which size it will be rotated as per the documentation in
          https://docs.python.org/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler
          If log_rotate_count is not also set, no log rotation will be performed. A value of 0 (the default) means no
          rotation. Size can be a number of bytes or a human-friendly representation like "100 MB" or "1G".

      log_rotate_count:
        type: int
        default: 0
        required: false
        desc: |
          Number of log file backups to keep, per the documentation in
          https://docs.python.org/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler
          Any additional rotated log files will automatically be pruned. If log_rotate_size is not also set, no log
          rotation will be performed. A value of 0 (the default) means no rotation.

      log_level:
        type: str
        default: DEBUG
        required: false
        desc: |
          Verbosity of console log messages. Acceptable values can be found here:
          https://docs.python.org/library/logging.html#logging-levels
          A custom debug level of "TRACE" is available for even more verbosity.

      logging:
        type: map
        allowempty: true
        desc: |
          Controls where and how the server logs messages. If set, overrides all settings in the log_* configuration
          options. Configuration is described in the documentation at:

      log_actions:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Turn on logging of user actions to the database.  Actions currently logged
          are grid views, tool searches, and use of "recently" used tools menu.  The
          log_events and log_actions functionality will eventually be merged.

      fluent_log:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false

        default: true
        required: false
        desc: |
          Sanitize all HTML tool output.  By default, all tool output served as
          'text/html' will be sanitized thoroughly.  This can be disabled if you have
          special tools that require unaltered output.  WARNING: disabling this does
          make the Galaxy instance susceptible to XSS attacks initiated by your users.

      sanitize_allowlist_file:
        type: str
        default: sanitize_allowlist.txt
        required: false
        desc: |
          Datasets created by tools listed in this file are trusted and will not have
          their HTML sanitized on display.  This can be manually edited or manipulated
          through the Admin control panel -- see "Manage Allowlist"

          The value of this option will be resolved with respect to <managed_config_dir>.

      serve_xss_vulnerable_mimetypes:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          By default Galaxy will serve non-HTML tool output that may potentially
          contain browser executable JavaScript content as plain text.  This will for
          instance cause SVG datasets to not render properly and so may be disabled
          by setting this option to true.

          When stopping Galaxy cleanly, how much time to give various monitoring/polling
          threads to finish before giving up on joining them. Set to 0 to disable this and
          terminate without waiting. Among others, these threads include the job handler
          workers, which are responsible for preparing/submitting and collecting/finishing
          jobs, and which can cause job errors if not shut down cleanly. If using
          supervisord, consider also increasing the value of `stopwaitsecs`. See the
          Galaxy Admin Documentation for more.

      use_heartbeat:

        default: 20
        required: false
        desc: |
          Control the period (in seconds) between dumps. Use -1 to disable. Regardless
          of this setting, if use_heartbeat is enabled, you can send a Galaxy process
          SIGUSR1 (`kill -USR1`) to force a dump.

      heartbeat_log:

        desc: |
          Log to Sentry
          Sentry is an open source logging and error aggregation platform.  Setting
          sentry_dsn will enable the Sentry middleware and errors will be sent to the
          indicated sentry instance.  This connection string is available in your
          sentry instance under <project_name> -> Settings -> API Keys.

      sentry_event_level:
        type: str
        default: ERROR
        required: false

        type: float
        default: 0.0
        required: false
        desc: |
          Set to a number between 0 and 1. With this option set, every transaction created
          will have that percentage chance of being sent to Sentry. A value higher than 0
          is required to analyze performance.

      sentry_ca_certs:
        type: str
        required: False
        desc: |
          Use this option to provide the path to location of the CA (Certificate Authority)

      user_library_import_dir:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          Add an option to the library upload form which allows authorized
          non-administrators to upload a directory of files.  The configured directory
          must contain sub-directories named the same as the non-admin user's Galaxy
          login ( email ).  The non-admin user is restricted to uploading files or
          sub-directories of files contained in their directory.

        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          For security reasons, users may not import any files that actually lie
          outside of their `user_library_import_dir` (e.g. using symbolic links). A
          list of directories can be allowed by setting the following option (the list
          is comma-separated). Be aware that *any* user with library import permissions
          can import from anywhere in these directories (assuming they are able to

          In conjunction or alternatively, Galaxy can restrict user library imports to
          those files that the user can read (by checking basic unix permissions).
          For this to work, the username has to match the username on the filesystem.

      allow_path_paste:

        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Allow admins to paste filesystem paths during upload. For libraries this
          adds an option to the admin library upload tool allowing admins to paste
          filesystem paths to files and directories in a box, and these paths will be
          added to a library.  For history uploads, this allows pasting in paths as URIs.
          (i.e. prefixed with file://). Set to true to enable.  Please note the security
          implication that this will give Galaxy Admins access to anything your Galaxy

          if testing shows that Galaxy is able to create files using these formats.
          Specific formats can be disabled with this option, separate more than one
          format with commas.  Available formats are currently 'zip', 'gz', and 'bz2'.

        desc: |
          The lower this parameter, the greater the diminishing reward for
          term frequency in the help text. A higher K1 increases the level
          of reward for additional occurences of a term. The default value will
          provide a slight increase in score for the first, second and third
          occurrence and little reward thereafter.

          Disabling this will prevent partial matches on tool names.
          Enable/disable Ngram-search for tools. It makes tool
          search results tolerant for spelling mistakes in the query, and will
          also match query substrings e.g. "genome" will match "genomics" or
          "metagenome".

        desc: |
          Ngram matched scores will be multiplied by this factor. Should always
          be below 1, because an ngram match is a partial match of a search term.

          Set tool test data directory. The test framework sets this value to
          'test-data,https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-test-data.git' which will
          cause Galaxy to clone down extra test data on the fly for certain tools
          distributed with Galaxy but this is likely not appropriate for production systems.
          Instead one can simply clone that repository directly and specify a path here
          instead of a Git HTTP repository.

        desc: |
          Galaxy encodes various internal values when these values will be output in
          some format (for example, in a URL or cookie).  You should set a key to be
          used by the algorithm that encodes and decodes these values. It can be any
          string with a length between 5 and 56 bytes.
          One simple way to generate a value for this is with the shell command:
            python -c 'from __future__ import print_function; import time; print(time.time())' | md5sum | cut -f 1 -d ' '

      use_remote_user:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          User authentication can be delegated to an upstream proxy server (usually
          Apache).  The upstream proxy should set a REMOTE_USER header in the request.
          Enabling remote user disables regular logins.  For more information, see:
          https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/special_topics/apache.html

      remote_user_maildomain:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          If use_remote_user is enabled and your external authentication
          method just returns bare usernames, set a default mail domain to be appended
          to usernames, to become your Galaxy usernames (email addresses).

      remote_user_header:
        type: str
        default: HTTP_REMOTE_USER
        required: false
        desc: |
          If use_remote_user is enabled, the header that the upstream proxy provides
          the remote username in defaults to HTTP_REMOTE_USER (the ``HTTP_`` is prepended
          by WSGI).  This option allows you to change the header.  Note, you still need
          to prepend ``HTTP_`` to the header in this option, but your proxy server should
          *not* include ``HTTP_`` at the beginning of the header name.

      remote_user_secret:
        type: str
        default: USING THE DEFAULT IS NOT SECURE!
        required: false
        desc: |
          If use_remote_user is enabled, anyone who can log in to the Galaxy host may
          impersonate any other user by simply sending the appropriate header.  Thus a
          secret shared between the upstream proxy server, and Galaxy is required.
          If anyone other than the Galaxy user is using the server, then apache/nginx
          should pass a value in the header 'GX_SECRET' that is identical to the one
          below.

      remote_user_logout_href:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          If use_remote_user is enabled, you can set this to a URL that will log your
          users out.

        type: str
        default: /root/login?is_logout_redirect=true

        desc: |
          If your proxy and/or authentication source does not normalize e-mail
          addresses or user names being passed to Galaxy - set this option
          to true to force these to lower case.

      single_user:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          If an e-mail address is specified here, it will hijack remote user mechanics
          (``use_remote_user``) and have the webapp inject a single fixed user. This
          has the effect of turning Galaxy into a single user application with no
          login or external proxy required. Such applications should not be exposed to
          the world.

        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          By default, users' data will be public, but setting this to true will cause
          it to be private.  Does not affect existing users and data, only ones created
          after this option is set.  Users may still change their default back to
          public.

      expose_user_name:

        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Expose user list.  Setting this to true will expose the user list to
          authenticated users.  This makes sharing datasets in smaller galaxy instances
          much easier as they can type a name/email and have the correct user show up.
          This makes less sense on large public Galaxy instances where that data
          shouldn't be exposed.  For semi-public Galaxies, it may make sense to expose
          just the username and not email, or vice versa.

          If enable_beta_gdpr is set to true, then this option will be
          overridden and set to false.

        required: false
        desc: |
          List of allowed local network addresses for "Upload from URL" dialog.
          By default, Galaxy will deny access to the local network address space, to
          prevent users making requests to services which the administrator did not
          intend to expose. Previously, you could request any network service that
          Galaxy might have had access to, even if the user could not normally access it.
          It should be a comma-separated list of IP addresses or IP address/mask, e.g.

          Enables GDPR Compliance mode. This makes several changes to the way
          Galaxy logs and exposes data externally such as removing emails and
          usernames from logs and bug reports. It also causes the delete user
          admin action to permanently redact their username and password, but
          not to delete data associated with the account as this is not
          currently easily implementable.

          You are responsible for removing personal data from backups.

          This forces expose_user_email and expose_user_name to be false, and
          forces user_deletion to be true to support the right to erasure.

          Please read the GDPR section under the special topics area of the
          admin documentation.

          a panel view defined using the panel_views or panel_views_dir configuration options or an
          EDAM panel view. The default panel view is simply called `default` and refers to the tool

        required: false
        desc: |
          If multiple job handlers are enabled, allow Galaxy to schedule workflow invocations
          in multiple handlers simultaneously. This is discouraged because it results in a
          less predictable order of workflow datasets within in histories.

        required: false
        desc: |
          This is the maximum amount of time a workflow invocation may stay in an active
          scheduling state in seconds. Set to -1 to disable this maximum and allow any workflow
          invocation to schedule indefinitely. The default corresponds to 1 month.

      maximum_workflow_jobs_per_scheduling_iteration:
        type: int
        default: 1000
        required: false
        desc: |
          Specify a maximum number of jobs that any given workflow scheduling iteration can create.
          Set this to a positive integer to prevent large collection jobs in a workflow from
          preventing other jobs from executing. This may also mitigate memory issues associated with
          scheduling workflows at the expense of increased total DB traffic because model objects
          are expunged from the SQL alchemy session between workflow invocation scheduling iterations.
          Set to -1 to disable any such maximum.

      flush_per_n_datasets:
        type: int
        default: 1000
        required: false
        desc: |
          Maximum number of datasets to create before flushing created datasets to database.
          This affects tools that create many output datasets.
          Higher values will lead to fewer database flushes and faster execution, but require
          more memory. Set to -1 to disable creating datasets in batches.

      max_discovered_files:
        type: int
        default: 10000
        required: false
        desc: |
          Set this to a positive integer value to limit the number of datasets that can be discovered by
          a single job. This prevents accidentally creating large numbers of datasets when running tools
          that create a potentially unlimited number of output datasets, such as tools that split a file

          Sets the prefix for OIDC scopes specific to this Galaxy instance.
          If an API call is made against this Galaxy instance using an OIDC bearer token,
          any scopes must be prefixed with this value e.g. https://galaxyproject.org/api.
          More concretely, to request all permissions that the user has, the scope
          would have to be specified as "<prefix>:*". e.g "https://galaxyproject.org/api:*".
          Currently, only * is recognised as a valid scope, and future iterations may

        deprecated_alias: master_api_key
        desc: |
          API key that allows performing some admin actions without actually
          having a real admin user in the database and config.
          Only set this if you need to bootstrap Galaxy, in particular to create
          a real admin user account via API.
          You should probably not set this on a production server.

      organization_name:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          The name of the organization that operates this Galaxy instance. Serves as the
          default for the GA4GH service organization name and can be exposed through Galaxy
          markdown for reports and such. For instance, "Not Evil Corporation".

          For GA4GH APIs, this is exposed via the service-info endpoint for the Galaxy DRS API.
          If unset, one will be generated using ga4gh_service_id (but only in the context
          of GA4GH APIs).

          This value should likely reflect your service's URL. For instance for usegalaxy.org
          this value should be org.usegalaxy. Particular Galaxy implementations will treat this
          value as a prefix and append the service type to this ID. For instance for the DRS
          service "id" (available via the DRS API) for the above configuration value would be
          org.usegalaxy.drs.

      ga4gh_service_environment:

      enable_tool_tags:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Enable tool tags (associating tools with tags).  This has its own option
          since its implementation has a few performance implications on startup for
          large servers.

      enable_unique_workflow_defaults:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Enable a feature when running workflows.  When enabled, default datasets
          are selected for "Set at Runtime" inputs from the history such that the
          same input will not be selected twice, unless there are more inputs than
          compatible datasets in the history.
          When false, the most recently added compatible item in the history will
          be used for each "Set at Runtime" input, independent of others in the workflow.

      simplified_workflow_run_ui:
        type: str
        default: 'prefer'
        enum: ['off', 'prefer']
        required: false
        per_host: true
        desc: |
          If set to 'off' by default, always use the traditional workflow form that renders
          all steps in the GUI and serializes the tool state of all steps during
          invocation. Set to 'prefer' to default to a simplified workflow UI that
          only renders the inputs if possible (the workflow must have no disconnected
          runtime inputs and not replacement parameters within tool steps). In the
          future 'force' may be added an option for Galaskio-style servers that should
          only render simplified workflows.

      simplified_workflow_run_ui_target_history:
        type: str
        default: 'prefer_current'
        enum: ['current', 'new', 'prefer_current', 'prefer_new']
        required: false
        per_host: true
        desc: |
          When the simplified workflow run form is rendered, should the invocation outputs
          be sent to the 'current' history or a 'new' history. If the user should be presented
          and option between these - set this to 'prefer_current' or 'prefer_new' to display
          a runtime setting with the corresponding default. The default is to provide the
          user this option and default it to the current history (the traditional behavior
          of Galaxy for years) - this corresponds to the setting 'prefer_current'.

      simplified_workflow_run_ui_job_cache:
        type: str
        default: 'off'
        enum: ['on', 'off']
        required: false
        per_host: true
        desc: |
          When the simplified workflow run form is rendered, should the invocation use job
          caching. This isn't a boolean so an option for 'show-selection' can be added later.

      ftp_upload_site:
        type: str
        required: false
        per_host: true
        desc: |
          Enable Galaxy's "Upload via FTP" interface.  You'll need to install and
          configure an FTP server (we've used ProFTPd since it can use Galaxy's
          database for authentication) and set the following two options.
          This will be provided to users in the help text as 'log in to the FTP
          server at '. Thus, it should be the hostname of your FTP server.

      ftp_upload_dir:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          This should point to a directory containing subdirectories matching users'
          identifier (defaults to e-mail), where Galaxy will look for files.

      ftp_upload_dir_identifier:
        type: str
        default: email
        required: false
        desc: |
          User attribute to use as subdirectory in calculating default ftp_upload_dir
          pattern. By default this will be email so a user's FTP upload directory will be
          ${ftp_upload_dir}/${user.email}. Can set this to other attributes such as id or
          username though.

      ftp_upload_dir_template:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          Python string template used to determine an FTP upload directory for a
          particular user.

          Defaults to '${ftp_upload_dir}/${ftp_upload_dir_identifier}'.

      ftp_upload_purge:
        type: bool
        default: true
        required: false
        desc: |
          Set to false to prevent Galaxy from deleting uploaded FTP files
          as it imports them.

      enable_quotas:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Enable enforcement of quotas.  Quotas can be set from the Admin interface.

      expose_dataset_path:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          This option allows users to see the full path of datasets via the "View
          Details" option in the history. This option also exposes the command line to
          non-administrative users. Administrators can always see dataset paths.

      enable_tool_source_display:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          This option allows users to view the tool wrapper source code. This is
          safe to enable if you have not hardcoded any secrets in any of the tool
          wrappers installed on this Galaxy server. If you have only installed tool
          wrappers from  public tool sheds and tools shipped with Galaxy there you
          can enable this option.

      job_metrics_config_file:
        type: str
        default: job_metrics_conf.xml
        path_resolves_to: config_dir
        required: false
        desc: |
          YAML or XML config file that contains the job metric collection configuration.

      job_metrics:
        type: seq
        sequence:
          - type: any
        desc: |
          Rather than specifying a job_metrics_config_file, the definition of the
          metrics to enable can be embedded into Galaxy's config with this option.
          This has no effect if a job_metrics_config_file is used.

          The syntax, available instrumenters, and documentation of their options is explained in detail in the
          documentation:

          https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/job_metrics.html

          By default, the core plugin is enabled. Setting this option to false or an empty list disables metrics
          entirely.

      expose_potentially_sensitive_job_metrics:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false

        required: false
        desc: |
          To increase performance of job execution and the web interface, you can
          separate Galaxy into multiple processes.  There are more than one way to do
          this, and they are explained in detail in the documentation:

          https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/scaling.html

          By default, Galaxy manages and executes jobs from within a single process and
          notifies itself of new jobs via in-memory queues.  Jobs are run locally on
          the system on which Galaxy is started.  Advanced job running capabilities can
          be configured through the job configuration file or the <job_config> option.

      default_job_resubmission_condition:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          When jobs fail due to job runner problems, Galaxy can be configured to retry
          these or reroute the jobs to new destinations. Very fine control of this is
          available with resubmit declarations in the job config. For simple deployments
          of Galaxy though, the following attribute can define resubmission conditions
          for all job destinations. If any job destination defines even one
          resubmission condition explicitly in the job config - the condition described
          by this option will not apply to that destination. For instance, the condition:
          'attempt < 3 and unknown_error and (time_running < 300 or time_since_queued < 300)'
          would retry up to two times jobs that didn't fail due to detected memory or
          walltime limits but did fail quickly (either while queueing or running). The
          commented out default below results in no default job resubmission condition,
          failing jobs are just failed outright.

      track_jobs_in_database:
        type: bool
        default: true
        required: false
        desc: |
          This option is deprecated, use the `mem-self` handler assignment option in the

      use_tasked_jobs:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          This enables splitting of jobs into tasks, if specified by the particular tool
          config.
          This is a new feature and not recommended for production servers yet.

      local_task_queue_workers:
        type: int

        default: 1.0
        required: false
        desc: |
          Each Galaxy job handler process runs one thread responsible for discovering jobs and
          dispatching them to runners. This thread operates in a loop and sleeps for the given
          number of seconds at the end of each iteration. This can be decreased if extremely high
          job throughput is necessary, but doing so can increase CPU usage of handler processes.
          Float values are allowed.

      job_runner_monitor_sleep:
        type: float
        default: 1.0
        required: false
        desc: |
          Each Galaxy job handler process runs one thread per job runner plugin responsible for
          checking the state of queued and running jobs.  This thread operates in a loop and
          sleeps for the given number of seconds at the end of each iteration. This can be
          decreased if extremely high job throughput is necessary, but doing so can increase CPU
          usage of handler processes. Float values are allowed.

      workflow_monitor_sleep:

        default: 1.0
        required: false
        desc: |
          Each Galaxy workflow handler process runs one thread responsible for
          checking the state of active workflow invocations.  This thread operates in a loop and
          sleeps for the given number of seconds at the end of each iteration. This can be
          decreased if extremely high job throughput is necessary, but doing so can increase CPU
          usage of handler processes. Float values are allowed.

        required: false
        enum: ['always', 'upload', 'never']
        desc: |
          In which cases Galaxy should calculate a hash for a new dataset.
          Dataset hashes can be used by the Galaxy job cache/search to check if job inputs match.
          Setting the 'enable_celery_tasks' option to true is also required for dataset hash calculation.
          Possible values are: 'always', 'upload' (the default), 'never'. If set to 'upload', the
          hash is calculated only for the outputs of upload jobs.

      hash_function:
        type: str
        default: sha256
        required: false
        desc: |
          Hash function to use if 'calculate_dataset_hash' is enabled. Possible values
          are: 'md5', 'sha1', 'sha256', 'sha512'

      metadata_strategy:
        type: str
        required: false
        default: directory
        desc: |
          Determines how metadata will be set. Valid values are `directory`, `extended`,
          `directory_celery` and `extended_celery`.
          In extended mode jobs will decide if a tool run failed, the object stores
          configuration is serialized and made available to the job and is used for
          writing output datasets to the object store as part of the job and dynamic
          output discovery (e.g. discovered datasets <discover_datasets>, unpopulated collections,
          etc) happens as part of the job. In `directory_celery` and `extended_celery` metadata
          will be set within a celery task.

      retry_metadata_internally:
        type: bool
        default: true
        required: false
        desc: |
          Although it is fairly reliable, setting metadata can occasionally fail.  In
          these instances, you can choose to retry setting it internally or leave it in
          a failed state (since retrying internally may cause the Galaxy process to be
          unresponsive).  If this option is set to false, the user will be given the
          option to retry externally, or set metadata manually (when possible).

      max_metadata_value_size:
        type: int
        default: 5242880
        required: false
        desc: |
          Very large metadata values can cause Galaxy crashes.  This will allow
          limiting the maximum metadata key size (in bytes used in memory, not the end
          result database value size) Galaxy will attempt to save with a dataset.  Use
          0 to disable this feature.  The default is 5MB, but as low as 1MB seems to be
          a reasonable size.

      outputs_to_working_directory:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          This option will override tool output paths to write outputs to the job
          working directory (instead of to the file_path) and the job manager will move
          the outputs to their proper place in the dataset directory on the Galaxy
          server after the job completes. This is necessary (for example) if jobs run
          on a cluster and datasets can not be created by the user running the jobs (e.g.
          if the filesystem is mounted read-only or the jobs are run by a different
          user than the galaxy user).

      retry_job_output_collection:
        type: int
        default: 0
        required: false
        desc: |
          If your network filesystem's caching prevents the Galaxy server from seeing
          the job's stdout and stderr files when it completes, you can retry reading
          these files.  The job runner will retry the number of times specified below,
          waiting 1 second between tries.  For NFS, you may want to try the -noac mount
          option (Linux) or -actimeo=0 (Solaris).

      tool_evaluation_strategy:
        type: str
        default: local
        required: false
        desc: |
          Determines which process will evaluate the tool command line. If set to "local" the tool command
          line, configuration files and other dynamic values will be templated in the job
          handler process. If set to ``remote`` the tool command line will be built as part of the
          submitted job. Note that ``remote`` is a beta setting that will be useful for materializing
          deferred datasets as part of the submitted job. Note also that you have to set ``metadata_strategy``
          to ``extended`` if you set this option to ``remote``.

      preserve_python_environment:
        type: str
        default: legacy_only
        required: false
        desc: |
          In the past Galaxy would preserve its Python environment when running jobs (
          and still does for internal tools packaged with Galaxy). This behavior exposes
          Galaxy internals to tools and could result in problems when activating
          Python environments for tools (such as with Conda packaging). The default
          legacy_only will restrict this behavior to tools identified by the Galaxy
          team as requiring this environment. Set this to "always" to restore the
          previous behavior (and potentially break Conda dependency resolution for many
          tools). Set this to legacy_and_local to preserve the environment for legacy
          tools and locally managed tools (this might be useful for instance if you are
          installing software into Galaxy's virtualenv for tool development).

      cleanup_job:

        enum: ['always', 'onsuccess', 'never']
        desc: |
          Clean up various bits of jobs left on the filesystem after completion.  These
          bits include the job working directory, external metadata temporary files,
          and DRM stdout and stderr files (if using a DRM).  Possible values are:
          always, onsuccess, never

      drmaa_external_runjob_script:

          (https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/cluster.html#submitting-jobs-as-the-real-user)
          this script is used to run the job script Galaxy generates for a tool execution.

          Example value 'sudo -E scripts/drmaa_external_runner.py --assign_all_groups'

      drmaa_external_killjob_script:

          (https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/cluster.html#submitting-jobs-as-the-real-user)
          this script is used to kill such jobs by Galaxy (e.g. if the user cancels
          the job).

          Example value 'sudo -E scripts/drmaa_external_killer.py'

      external_chown_script:
        type: str

          When running DRMAA jobs as the Galaxy user
          (https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/cluster.html#submitting-jobs-as-the-real-user)
          this script is used transfer permissions back and forth between the Galaxy user
          and the user that is running the job.

          Example value 'sudo -E scripts/external_chown_script.py'

      real_system_username:
        type: str
        default: user_email
        required: false
        desc: |
          When running DRMAA jobs as the Galaxy user
          (https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/cluster.html#submitting-jobs-as-the-real-user)
          Galaxy can extract the user name from the email address (actually the local-part before the @)
          or the username which are both stored in the Galaxy data base.
          The latter option is particularly useful for installations that get the
          authentication from LDAP.
          Also, Galaxy can accept the name of a common system user (eg. galaxy_worker)
          who can run every job being submitted. This user should not be the same user
          running the galaxy system.
          Possible values are user_email (default), username or <common_system_user>

      environment_setup_file:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          File to source to set up the environment when running jobs.  By default, the
          environment in which the Galaxy server starts is used when running jobs
          locally, and the environment set up per the DRM's submission method and
          policy is used when running jobs on a cluster (try testing with `qsub` on the
          command line).  environment_setup_file can be set to the path of a file on
          the cluster that should be sourced by the user to set up the environment
          prior to running tools.  This can be especially useful for running jobs as
          the actual user, to remove the need to configure each user's environment
          individually.

      enable_beta_markdown_export:
        type: bool

        default: job_resource_params_conf.xml
        path_resolves_to: config_dir
        required: false
        desc: |
          Optional file containing job resource data entry fields definition.
          These fields will be presented to users in the tool forms and allow them to
          overwrite default job resources such as number of processors, memory and
          walltime.

      workflow_resource_params_file:
        type: str
        default: workflow_resource_params_conf.xml
        path_resolves_to: config_dir
        required: false
        desc: |
          Similar to the above parameter, workflows can describe parameters used to
          influence scheduling of jobs within the workflow. This requires both a description
          of the fields available (which defaults to the definitions in
          job_resource_params_file if not set).

      workflow_resource_params_mapper:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          This parameter describes how to map users and workflows to a set of workflow
          resource parameter to present (typically input IDs from workflow_resource_params_file).
          If this this is a function reference it will be passed various inputs (workflow model
          object and user) and it should produce a list of input IDs. If it is a path
          it is expected to be an XML or YAML file describing how to map group names to parameter
          descriptions (additional types of mappings via these files could be implemented but
          haven't yet - for instance using workflow tags to do the mapping).

          Sample default path 'config/workflow_resource_mapper_conf.yml.sample'

      workflow_schedulers_config_file:
        type: str
        default: workflow_schedulers_conf.xml
        path_resolves_to: config_dir
        required: false
        desc: |
          Optional configuration file similar to `job_config_file` to specify
          which Galaxy processes should schedule workflows.

      workflow_scheduling_separate_materialization_iteration:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Workflows launched with URI/URL inputs that are not marked as 'deferred'
          are "materialized" (or undeferred) by the workflow scheduler. This might be
          a lengthy process. Setting this to 'True' will place the invocation back in
          the queue after materialization before scheduling the workflow so it is less
          likely to starve other workflow scheduling. Ideally, Galaxy would allow more
          fine grain control of handlers but until then, this provides a way to tip the
          balance between "doing more work" and "being more fair". The default here is
          pretty arbitrary - it has been to False to optimize Galaxy for automated,
          single user applications where "fairness" is mostly irrelevant.

      cache_user_job_count:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          If using job concurrency limits (configured in job_config_file), several
          extra database queries must be performed to determine the number of jobs a
          user has dispatched to a given destination.  By default, these queries will
          happen for every job that is waiting to run, but if cache_user_job_count is
          set to true, it will only happen once per iteration of the handler queue.
          Although better for performance due to reduced queries, the trade-off is a
          greater possibility that jobs will be dispatched past the configured limits
          if running many handlers.

      toolbox_auto_sort:
        type: bool
        default: true
        required: false
        reloadable: true
        desc: |
          If true, the toolbox will be sorted by tool id when the toolbox is loaded.
          This is useful for ensuring that tools are always displayed in the same
          order in the UI.  If false, the order of tools in the toolbox will be
          preserved as they are loaded from the tool config files.

      tool_filters:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |

        required: false
        desc: |
          Galaxy uses AMQP internally for communicating between processes.  For
          example, when reloading the toolbox or locking job execution, the process
          that handled that particular request will tell all others to also reload,
          lock jobs, etc.
          For connection examples, see https://docs.celeryq.dev/projects/kombu/en/stable/userguide/connections.html

          Without specifying anything here, galaxy will first attempt to use your
          specified database_connection above.  If that's not specified either, Galaxy
          will automatically create and use a separate sqlite database located in your

          Offload long-running tasks to a Celery task queue.
          Activate this only if you have setup a Celery worker for Galaxy and you have
          configured the `celery_conf` option below. Specifically, you need to set the
          `result_backend` option in the `celery_conf` option to a valid Celery result
          backend URL. By default, Galaxy uses an SQLite database at '<data_dir>/results.sqlite' for storing task results.

        desc: |
          Configuration options passed to Celery.

          To refer to a task by name, use the template `galaxy.foo` where `foo` is the function name
          of the task defined in the galaxy.celery.tasks module.

          The `broker_url` option, if unset or null, defaults to the value of `amqp_internal_connection`.
          The `result_backend` option, if unset or null, defaults to an SQLite database at '<data_dir>/results.sqlite'
          for storing task results. Please use a more robust backend (e.g. Redis) for production setups.

          The galaxy.fetch_data task can be disabled by setting its route to "disabled": `galaxy.fetch_data: disabled`.
          (Other tasks cannot be disabled on a per-task basis at this time.)
