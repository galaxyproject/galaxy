          The Tool Shed encodes various internal values when these values will be output in
          some format (for example, in a URL or cookie).  You should set a key to be
          used by the algorithm that encodes and decodes these values.  It can be any
          string.  If left unchanged, anyone could construct a cookie that would grant
          them access to others' sessions.
          One simple way to generate a value for this is with the shell command:
            python -c 'from __future__ import print_function; import time; print(time.time())' | md5sum | cut -f 1 -d ' '

      use_remote_user:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          User authentication can be delegated to an upstream proxy server (usually
          Apache).  The upstream proxy should set a REMOTE_USER header in the request.
          Enabling remote user disables regular logins.  For more information, see:
          https://galaxyproject.org/admin/config/apache-external-user-auth/

      remote_user_secret:
        type: str
        default: changethisinproductiontoo
        required: false
        desc: |
          If use_remote_user is enabled, anyone who can log in to the Galaxy host may
          impersonate any other user by simply sending the appropriate header. Thus a
          secret shared between the upstream proxy server, and Galaxy is required.
          If anyone other than the Galaxy user is using the server, then apache/nginx
          should pass a value in the header 'GX_SECRET' that is identical the one below

      remote_user_maildomain:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          If use_remote_user is enabled and your external authentication
          method just returns bare usernames, set a default mail domain to be appended
          to usernames, to become your Galaxy usernames (email addresses).

      remote_user_header:
        type: str
        default: HTTP_REMOTE_USER
        required: false
        desc: |
          If use_remote_user is enabled, the header that the upstream proxy provides
          the remote username in defaults to HTTP_REMOTE_USER (the 'HTTP_' is prepended
          by WSGI).  This option allows you to change the header.  Note, you still need
          to prepend 'HTTP_' to the header in this option, but your proxy server should
          *not* include 'HTTP_' at the beginning of the header name.

      remote_user_logout_href:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          If use_remote_user is enabled, you can set this to a URL that will log your

          Apache can handle file downloads (Galaxy-to-user) via mod_xsendfile.  Set

        desc: |
          E-mail domains blocklist is used for filtering out users that are using

      email_domain_allowlist_file:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          E-mail domains allowlist is used to specify allowed email address domains.
          If the list is non-empty and a user attempts registration using an email
          address belonging to a domain that is not on the list, registration will be
          denied. This is a more restrictive option than <email_domain_blocklist_file>, and
          therefore, in case <email_domain_allowlist_file> is set and is not empty,
          <email_domain_blocklist_file> will be ignored.

          Turn on logging of user actions to the database.  Actions currently logged
          are grid views, tool searches, and use of "recently" used tools menu.  The
          log_events and log_actions functionality will eventually be merged.

      password_expiration_period:
        type: int
        default: 0
        required: false
        desc: |
          Password expiration period (in days). Users are required to change their
          password every x days. Users will be redirected to the change password

          Sentry is an open source logging and error aggregation platform.  Setting
          sentry_dsn will enable the Sentry middleware and errors will be sent to the
          indicated sentry instance.  This connection string is available in your

        desc: |
          XML config file that allows the use of different authentication providers

        required: false
        desc: |
          XML config file that contains additional data table entries for the
          ToolDataTableManager.  This file is automatically generated based on the
          current installed tool shed repositories that contain valid
          tool_data_table_conf.xml.sample files.  At the time of installation, these
          entries are automatically added to the following file, which is parsed and
          applied to the ToolDataTableManager at server start up.

      datatypes_config_file:

        required: false
        desc: |
          Datatypes config file(s), defines what data (file) types are available in
          Galaxy (.sample is used if default does not exist).  If a datatype appears in
          multiple files, the last definition is used (though the first sniffer is used
          so limit sniffer definitions to one file).
