  description: |
    eLabFTW is a free and open source electronic lab notebook from Deltablot. It can keep track of experiments,
    equipment, and materials from a research lab. Each lab can either host their own installation or go for Deltablot's
    hosted solution. This template configuration allows you to connect to an eLabFTW instance of your choice.
  variables:
    endpoint:
      label: eLabFTW instance endpoint (e.g. https://demo.elabftw.net)
      type: string
      help: |
        The endpoint of the eLabFTW server you are connecting to. This should be the full URL including the protocol
        (http or https) and the domain name.
    writable:
      label: Allow Galaxy to export data to eLabFTW?
      type: boolean
      default: true
      help: |
        Allow Galaxy to write data to this eLabFTW instance. Set it to "Yes" if you want to export data from Galaxy to
        eLabFTW, set it to "No" if you only need to import data from eLabFTW to Galaxy. Keep in mind that your API key
        must have matching permissions.
  secrets:
    api_key:
      label: API Key
      help: |
        The API key to use to connect to the eLabFTW server. Navigate to the _Settings_ page on your eLabFTW server and
        go to the _API Keys_ tab to generate a new key. Choose "Read/Write" permissions to enable both importing and
        exporting data. "Read Only" API keys still work for importing data to Galaxy, but they will cause Galaxy to
        error out when exporting data to eLabFTW.
