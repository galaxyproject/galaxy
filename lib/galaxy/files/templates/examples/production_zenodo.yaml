  description: |
      Zenodo is an open-access repository for research data, software, publications, and other digital artifacts. It is developed
      and maintained by CERN and funded by the European Commission as part of the OpenAIRE project. Zenodo provides a free
      platform for researchers to share and preserve their work, ensuring long-term access and reproducibility.
      Zenodo is widely used by researchers, institutions, and organizations to share scientific knowledge and comply
      with open-access mandates from funding agencies.
  variables:
      writable:
          label: Allow Galaxy to export data to Zenodo?
          type: boolean
          default: true
          help: |
              Set it to "Yes" if you want to export data from Galaxy to Zenodo, set it to "No" if you only need to import
              data from Zenodo to Galaxy.
      public_name:
          label: Publication Name
          type: string
          help: |
              The name of the person or organization that is creating the records in Zenodo. This will be used as the
              "creator" field in the metadata of the records. You can always change this value later by editing the records in
              Zenodo. If left blank, an anonymous user will be used as the creator.
  secrets:
      token:
          label: Personal Access Token
          help: |
              The personal access token to use to connect to Zenodo. Go to your Account Settings and then go to Applications
              here https://zenodo.org/account/settings/applications/. You can generate a new `Personal Access Token` if you don't have one yet.
              This will allow Galaxy to display your draft records and upload files to them. If you enabled the option to export data
                from Galaxy to Zenodo, make sure to enable the `deposit:write` scope when creating the token.

  configuration:
