      [InvenioRDM](https://inveniosoftware.org) is a research data management platform that allows you to store, share, and publish research data. It is
      built on top of the Invenio framework and is designed to be highly customizable. Here, you can connect to an InvenioRDM instance of your choice.
  variables:
      url:
          label: InvenioRDM instance endpoint (e.g. https://invenio.example.com)
          type: string
          help: |
              The endpoint of the InvenioRDM server you are connecting to. This should be the full URL including the protocol
              (http or https) and the domain name.
      writable:
          label: Allow Galaxy to export data to InvenioRDM?
          type: boolean
          default: true
          help: |
              Allow Galaxy to write data to this InvenioRDM instance. Set it to "Yes" if you want to export data from Galaxy to
              InvenioRDM, set it to "No" if you only need to import data from InvenioRDM to Galaxy.
      public_name:
          label: Publication Name
          type: string
          help: |
              The name of the person or organization that is creating the records in InvenioRDM. This will be used as the
              "creator" field in the metadata of the records. You can always change this value later by editing the records in
              InvenioRDM. If left blank, an anonymous user will be used as the creator.
  secrets:
      token:
          label: Personal Access Token
          help: |
              The personal access token to use to connect to the InvenioRDM server. In your InvenioRDM instance, go to your
              Account Settings and then go to Applications to generate a new token if you don't have one yet.
              This will allow Galaxy to display your draft records and upload files to them.
