    If you have an account in Onedata, you can use such a file source to upload

    an "Export datasets to remote files source" of a dataset from Galaxy to
    Onedata.

    The minimal supported Onezone version is 21.02.4.
    More information on Onedata can be found on [Onedata's website](https://onedata.org/#/home).
