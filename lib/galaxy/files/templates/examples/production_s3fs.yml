  description: |
    The APIs used to connect to Amazon's S3 (Simple Storage Service) have become something
    of an unofficial standard for cloud storage across a variety of vendors and services.
    Many vendors offer storage APIs compatible with S3. This template configuration allows
    using such service as a Galaxy storage location as long as you are able to find the
    connection details and have the relevant credentials.

    Given the amount of information needed to connect to such a service, this is a bit of an
    advanced template and probably should not be used to connect to a service if a more
    specific template is available.

        If the documentation for your storage service has something called an ``endpoint_url``,
        For instance, the CloudFlare documentation describes its endpoints as ``https://<accountid>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com``. Here
        you would substitute your CloudFlare account ID into the endpoint url and use that value.
        So if your account ID was ``galactian``, you would enter ``galactian.r2.cloudflarestorage.com``.
        The [MinIO](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/integrations/aws-cli-with-minio.html)
        documentation describes the endpoint URL for its Play service as ``https://play.min.io:9000``,
