      [The Dataverse Project](https://dataverse.org) is an open-source web application for sharing, preserving, citing, exploring, and analyzing research data. 
      It enables institutions and researchers to host and manage datasets with rich metadata and persistent identifiers. 
      This configuration allows you to connect Galaxy to a Dataverse instance of your choice.

      **Note:** Your **registered email address** will be used to create datasets in Dataverse.
  variables:
      url:
          label: Dataverse instance endpoint (e.g. https://demo.dataverse.org)
          type: string
          help: |
              The endpoint of the Dataverse server you are connecting to. This should be the full URL including the protocol
              (http or https) and the domain name.
      writable:
          label: Allow Galaxy to export data to Dataverse?
          type: boolean
          default: true
          help: |
              Allow Galaxy to write data to this Dataverse instance. Set it to "Yes" if you want to export data from Galaxy to
              Dataverse, set it to "No" if you only need to import data from Dataverse to Galaxy.
      public_name:
          label: Publication Name
          type: string
          help: |
              The name of the person or organization creating the datasets. This will be used in the dataset metadata as the
              creator. You can update this information later by editing the dataset in Dataverse. If left blank, an anonymous user will be used as the creator.
              **Note:** Your **registered email address** will be used to create datasets in Dataverse.
  secrets:
      token:
          label: API Token
          help: |
              The personal API token used to authenticate with the Dataverse server. You can generate this token in your
              Dataverse account settings under "API Token". It is required to access private data or upload datasets from Galaxy.

  configuration:
      type: dataverse
      url: "{{ variables.url }}"
      token: "{{ secrets.token }}"
      writable: "{{ variables.writable }}"
      public_name: "{{ variables.public_name }}"
