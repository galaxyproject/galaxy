"""
Backup resolvers for when dependencies can not be loaded from the database.
Mainly suited for testing stage.

Ideally all dependencies will be stored in the database
when a tool is added from a Tool Shed.

That should remain the preferred way of locating dependencies.

In cases where that is not possible
for example during testing this resolver can act as a backup.

This resolver looks not just for manually added dependencies
but also ones added from a Tool Shed.

This tool is still under development so the default behaviour could change.
It has been tested when placed in the same directory as galaxy_packages.py

At the time of writing July 3 2015 this resolver has to be plugged in.
See bottom for instructions on how to add this resolver.

At the time of writing July 3 2015 this resolver has to be plugged in.

Adding resolver instructions:

1. create a dependency_resolvers_config.xml file
<dependency_resolvers>
  <tool_shed_packages />
  <galaxy_packages />
  <galaxy_packages versionless="true" />
  <unlinked_tool_shed_packages />
</dependency_resolvers>


1a. ALWAYS add <tool_shed_packages /> first!!!!

1b. <galaxy_packages /> is optional as
    this resolver will also find dependency found by that resolver
1bi Current default is to use a dependency to find that way first!
1bii So an alternative version of dependency_resolvers_config.xml
<dependency_resolvers>
  <tool_shed_packages />
  <unlinked_tool_shed_packages />
  <unlinked_tool_shed_packages versionless="true" />
</dependency_resolvers>

1c. See __init__ for optional config values
1ci versionless currently is handled by the super class
    GalaxyPackageDependencyResolver

2. Add a parameter to config.ini
dependency_resolvers_config_file = ./config/dependency_resolvers_config.xml

2a. File name/path can be different
2b. config key must be dependency_resolvers_config_file

3. For planemo it may be required to specify:
--dependency_resolvers_config_file (xml file described in 1 above)
--tool_dependency_dir (root of dependencies typically galaxy/dependency_dir)
See planemo test --help for more information
