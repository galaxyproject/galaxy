  Galaxy is configured by default to be usable in a single-user development
  environment.  To tune the application for a multi-user production
  environment, see the documentation at:

   https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/production.html

  Throughout this sample configuration file, except where stated otherwise,
  uncommented values override the default if left unset, whereas commented
  values are set to the default value.  Relative paths are relative to the root
  Galaxy directory.

  Examples of many of these options are explained in more detail in the Galaxy
  Community Hub.

    https://galaxyproject.org/admin/config

        required: false
        desc: |
          When running multiple Galaxy instances under separate URL prefixes on a
          single hostname, you will want to set this to the same path as the prefix set
          in the uWSGI "mount" configuration option above. This value becomes the "path"
          attribute set in the cookie so the cookies from one instance will not clobber
          those from another.

        default: sqlite:///./database/universe.sqlite?isolation_level=IMMEDIATE
        required: false
        desc: |
          By default, Galaxy uses a SQLite database at 'database/universe.sqlite'.  You
          may use a SQLAlchemy connection string to specify an external database
          instead.  This string takes many options which are explained in detail in the
          config file documentation.

        type: int
        default: 5
        required: false
        desc: |
          If the server logs errors about not having enough database pool connections,
          you will want to increase these values, or consider running more Galaxy
          processes.

      database_engine_option_max_overflow:

        required: false
        desc: |
          If using MySQL and the server logs the error "MySQL server has gone away",
          you will want to set this to some positive value (7200 should work).

        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          If large database query results are causing memory or response time issues in
          the Galaxy process, leave the result on the server instead.  This option is
          only available for PostgreSQL and is highly recommended.

      database_query_profiling_proxy:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Log all database transactions, can be useful for debugging and performance
          profiling.  Logging is done via Python's 'logging' module under the qualname
          'galaxy.model.orm.logging_connection_proxy'

      database_template:
        type: str
        default: ''
        required: false
        desc: |
          If auto-creating a postgres database on startup - it can be based on an existing
          template database. This will set that. This is probably only useful for testing but
          documentation is included here for completeness.

      slow_query_log_threshold:
        type: int
        default: 0
        required: false
        desc: |
          Slow query logging.  Queries slower than the threshold indicated below will
          be logged to debug.  A value of '0' is disabled.  For example, you would set
          this to .005 to log all queries taking longer than 5 milliseconds.

      enable_per_request_sql_debugging:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Enable's a per request sql debugging option. If this is set to true, append
          ?sql_debug=1 to web request URLs to enable detailed logging on the backend of SQL
          queries generated during that request. This is useful for debugging slow endpoints
          during development.

        type: str
        default: sqlite:///./database/universe.sqlite?isolation_level=IMMEDIATE
        required: false
        desc: |
          By default, Galaxy will use the same database to track user data and
          tool shed install data.  There are many situations in which it is
          valuable to separate these - for instance bootstrapping fresh Galaxy
          instances with pretested installs.  The following option can be used to
          separate the tool shed install database (all other options listed above
          but prefixed with install_ are also available).

      database_auto_migrate:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Setting the following option to true will cause Galaxy to automatically
          migrate the database forward after updates. This is not recommended for production
          use.

      file_path:
        type: str
        default: database/files
        required: false
        desc: |
          Where dataset files are stored. It must accessible at the same path on any cluster
          nodes that will run Galaxy jobs, unless using Pulsar.

        type: str
        default: database/tmp
        required: false
        desc: |
          Where temporary files are stored. It must accessible at the same path on any cluster

        required: false
        desc: |
          Tool config files, defines what tools are available in Galaxy.
          Tools can be locally developed or installed from Galaxy tool sheds.
          (config/tool_conf.xml.sample will be used if left unset and
          config/tool_conf.xml does not exist).

      check_migrate_tools:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Enable / disable checking if any tools defined in the above non-shed
          tool_config_files (i.e., tool_conf.xml) have been migrated from the Galaxy
          code distribution to the Tool Shed. This functionality is largely untested
          in modern Galaxy releases and has serious issues such as #7273 and the possibility
          of slowing down Galaxy startup, so the default and recommended value is False.

      migrated_tools_config:
        type: str
        default: config/migrated_tools_conf.xml
        required: false
        desc: |
          Tool config maintained by tool migration scripts.  If you use the migration
          scripts to install tools that have been migrated to the tool shed upon a new
          release, they will be added to this tool config file.

      integrated_tool_panel_config:
        type: str
        default: integrated_tool_panel.xml
        required: false
        desc: |
          File that contains the XML section and tool tags from all tool panel config
          files integrated into a single file that defines the tool panel layout.  This
          file can be changed by the Galaxy administrator to alter the layout of the
          tool panel.  If not present, Galaxy will create it.

      tool_path:
        type: str
        default: tools
        required: false
        desc: |
          Default path to the directory containing the tools defined in tool_conf.xml.
          Other tool config files must include the tool_path as an attribute in the
          <toolbox> tag.

      tool_dependency_dir:
        type: str
        default: database/dependencies
        required: false
        desc: |
          Path to the directory in which tool dependencies are placed.  This is used by
          the Tool Shed to install dependencies and can also be used by administrators
          to manually install or link to dependencies.  For details, see:
            https://galaxyproject.org/admin/config/tool-dependencies
          Set the string to None to explicitly disable tool dependency handling.
          If this option is set to none or an invalid path, installing tools with dependencies
          from the Tool Shed will fail.

      dependency_resolvers_config_file:
        type: str
        default: config/dependency_resolvers_conf.xml
        required: false
        desc: |
          The dependency resolvers config file specifies an ordering and options for how
          Galaxy resolves tool dependencies (requirement tags in Tool XML). The default
          ordering is to the use the Tool Shed for tools installed that way, use local
          Galaxy packages, and then use Conda if available.
          See https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/doc/source/admin/dependency_resolvers.rst
          for more information on these options.

      conda_prefix:
        type: str
        default: <tool_dependency_dir>/_conda
        required: false
        desc: |
          conda_prefix is the location on the filesystem where Conda packages and environments are installed
          IMPORTANT: Due to a current limitation in conda, the total length of the
          conda_prefix and the job_working_directory path should be less than 50 characters!

      conda_exec:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          Override the Conda executable to use, it will default to the one on the
          PATH (if available) and then to <conda_prefix>/bin/conda

      conda_debug:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Pass debug flag to conda commands.

        type: str
        default: iuc,conda-forge,bioconda,defaults
        required: false
        desc: |
          conda channels to enable by default
          (https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-channels.html)

      conda_use_local:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Use locally-built conda packages.

      conda_auto_install:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Set to True to instruct Galaxy to look for and install missing tool
          dependencies before each job runs.

      conda_auto_init:
        type: bool
        default: true
        required: false
        desc: |
          Set to True to instruct Galaxy to install Conda from the web automatically
          if it cannot find a local copy and conda_exec is not configured.

      conda_copy_dependencies:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          You must set this to True if conda_prefix and job_working_directory are not on the same
          volume, or some conda dependencies will fail to execute at job runtime.
          Conda will copy packages content instead of creating hardlinks or symlinks.
          This will prevent problems with some specific packages (perl, R), at the cost
          of extra disk space usage and extra time spent copying packages.

      use_cached_dependency_manager:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Certain dependency resolvers (namely Conda) take a considerable amount of
          time to build an isolated job environment in the job_working_directory if the
          job working directory is on a network share.  Set the following option to True
          to cache the dependencies in a folder. This option is beta and should only be
          used if you experience long waiting times before a job is actually submitted
          to your cluster.

      tool_dependency_cache_dir:
        type: str
        default: <tool_dependency_dir>/_cache
        required: false
        desc: |
          By default the tool_dependency_cache_dir is the _cache directory
          of the tool dependency directory

      precache_dependencies:
        type: bool
        default: true
        required: false
        desc: |
          By default, when using a cached dependency manager, the dependencies are cached
          when installing new tools and when using tools for the first time.
          Set this to False if you prefer dependencies to be cached only when installing new tools.

      tool_sheds_config_file:
        type: str
        default: config/tool_sheds_conf.xml
        required: false
        desc: |
          File containing the Galaxy Tool Sheds that should be made available to
          install from in the admin interface (.sample used if default does not exist).

      watch_tools:
        type: str
        default: 'false'
        required: false
        desc: |
          Set to True to enable monitoring of tools and tool directories
          listed in any tool config file specified in tool_config_file option.
          If changes are found, tools are automatically reloaded.  Watchdog (
          https://pypi.org/project/watchdog/ ) must be installed and
          available to Galaxy to use this option. Other options include 'auto'
          which will attempt to watch tools if the watchdog library is available
          but won't fail to load Galaxy if it is not and 'polling' which will use
          a less efficient monitoring scheme that may work in wider range of scenarios
          than the watchdog default.

      watch_job_rules:
        type: str
        default: 'false'
        required: false
        desc: |
          Set to True to enable monitoring of dynamic job rules. If changes are
          found, rules are automatically reloaded. Takes the same values as the
          'watch_tools' option.

      legacy_eager_objectstore_initialization:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          As of 18.09, Galaxy defaults to setting up the object store configuration
          for output datasets during the job queue step in job handlers. This should generally
          provide for more robust job submission, more configurability, and a better
          user experience but may in some cases slightly slow down the job handler job
          setup process. On the off chance that an admin would like to or need to optimize job
          handlers at the expense of user experience and web handling this option will remain
          for some time by setting this option to true. This behavior however should be
          considered deprecated and this option will likely be removed in future versions of
          Galaxy. For more information see https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/issues/6513.

      enable_beta_mulled_containers:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          Enable Galaxy to fetch Docker containers registered with quay.io generated
          from tool requirements resolved through conda. These containers (when
          available) have been generated using mulled - https://github.com/mulled .
          These containers are highly beta and availability will vary by tool.
          This option will additionally only be used for job destinations with
          Docker enabled.

      containers_resolvers_config_file:
        type: str
        default: ''
        required: false
        desc: |
          Container resolvers configuration (beta). Setup a file describing container
          resolvers to use when discovering containers for Galaxy. If this is set to

        default: database/dependencies/involucro
        required: false
        desc: |
          involucro is a tool used to build Docker or Singularity containers for tools from Conda
          dependencies referenced in tools as `requirement`s. The following path is
          the location of involucro on the Galaxy host. This is ignored if the relevant
          container resolver isn't enabled, and will install on demand unless
          involucro_auto_init is set to False.

      involucro_auto_init:
        type: bool
        default: true
        required: false

        required: false
        desc: |
          Enable automatic polling of relative tool sheds to see if any updates
          are available for installed repositories.  Ideally only one Galaxy
          server process should be able to check for repository updates.  The
          setting for hours_between_check should be an integer between 1 and 24.

        required: false
        desc: |
          XML config file that contains additional data table entries for the
          ToolDataTableManager.  This file is automatically generated based on the
          current installed tool shed repositories that contain valid
          tool_data_table_conf.xml.sample files.  At the time of installation, these
          entries are automatically added to the following file, which is parsed and
          applied to the ToolDataTableManager at server start up.

      tool_data_path:

          defaults to bash for all jobs and can be overridden at the destination
          level for heterogeneous clusters. conda job resolution requires bash or zsh
          so if this is switched to /bin/sh for instance - conda resolution
          should be disabled. Containerized jobs always use /bin/sh - so more maximum

          Galaxy can display data at various external browsers.  These options specify
          which browsers should be available.  URLs and builds available at these
          browsers are defined in the specifield files.

          If use_remote_user = True, display application servers will be denied access
          to Galaxy and so displaying datasets in these sites will fail.
          display_servers contains a list of hostnames which should be allowed to
          bypass security to display datasets.  Please be aware that there are security
          implications if this is allowed.  More details (including required changes to
          the proxy server config) are available in the Apache proxy documentation on
          the Galaxy Community Hub.

          The list of servers in this sample config are for the UCSC Main, Test and
          Archaea browsers, but the default if left commented is to not allow any
          display sites to bypass security (you must uncomment the line below to allow
          them).

          To disable the old-style display applications that are hardcoded into
          datatype classes, set enable_old_display_applications = False.
          This may be desirable due to using the new-style, XML-defined, display
          applications that have been defined for many of the datatypes that have the
          old-style.
          There is also a potential security concern with the old-style applications,
          where a malicious party could provide a link that appears to reference the
          Galaxy server, but contains a redirect to a third-party server, tricking a
          Galaxy user to access said site.

          Apache can handle file downloads (Galaxy-to-user) via mod_xsendfile.  Set
          this to True to inform Galaxy that mod_xsendfile is enabled upstream.

      nginx_x_accel_redirect_base:

        required: false
        desc: |
          The following default adds a header to web request responses that
          will cause modern web browsers to not allow Galaxy to be embedded in
          the frames of web applications hosted at other hosts - this can help
          prevent a class of attack called clickjacking
          (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking).  If you configure a
          proxy in front of Galaxy - please ensure this header remains intact
          to protect your users.  Uncomment and leave empty to not set the
          `X-Frame-Options` header.

      nginx_upload_store:

        required: false
        desc: |
          nginx can also handle file uploads (user-to-Galaxy) via nginx_upload_module.
          Configuration for this is complex and explained in detail in the
          documentation linked above.  The upload store is a temporary directory in
          which files uploaded by the upload module will be placed.

      nginx_upload_path:
        type: str
        default: ''

        desc: |
          This value overrides the action set on the file upload form, e.g. the web

          requests.

      nginx_upload_job_files_store:
        type: str
        default: ''
        required: false
        desc: |
          Galaxy can also use nginx_upload_module to receive files staged out upon job
          completion by remote job runners (i.e. Pulsar) that initiate staging
          operations on the remote end.  See the Galaxy nginx documentation for the
          corresponding nginx configuration.

        desc: |
          Galaxy can upload user files in chunks without using nginx. Enable the chunk
          uploader by specifying a chunk size larger than 0. The chunk size is specified
          in bytes (default: 100MB).

      dynamic_proxy_manage:
        type: bool
        default: true
        required: false
        desc: |
          Have Galaxy manage dynamic proxy component for routing requests to other
          services based on Galaxy's session cookie.  It will attempt to do this by
          default though you do need to install node+npm and do an npm install from
          `lib/galaxy/web/proxy/js`.  It is generally more robust to configure this
          externally, managing it however Galaxy is managed.  If True, Galaxy will only
          launch the proxy if it is actually going to be used (e.g. for Jupyter).

      dynamic_proxy:
        type: str
        default: node
        required: false
        desc: |
          As of 16.04 Galaxy supports multiple proxy types. The original NodeJS
          implementation, alongside a new Golang single-binary-no-dependencies
          version. Valid values are (node, golang)

      dynamic_proxy_session_map:

        type: int
        default: 8800
        required: false
        desc: |
          Set the port and IP for the the dynamic proxy to bind to, this must match
          the external configuration if dynamic_proxy_manage is False.

      dynamic_proxy_bind_ip:
        type: str
        default: 0.0.0.0
        required: false
        desc: |
          Set the port and IP for the the dynamic proxy to bind to, this must match
          the external configuration if dynamic_proxy_manage is False.

      dynamic_proxy_debug:
        type: bool

        required: false
        desc: |
          Enable verbose debugging of Galaxy-managed dynamic proxy.

      dynamic_proxy_external_proxy:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          The dynamic proxy is proxied by an external proxy (e.g. apache frontend to
          nodejs to wrap connections in SSL).

      dynamic_proxy_prefix:
        type: str
        default: gie_proxy
        required: false
        desc: |
          Additionally, when the dynamic proxy is proxied by an upstream server, you'll
          want to specify a prefixed URL so both Galaxy and the proxy reside under the
          same path that your cookies are under. This will result in a url like
          https://FQDN/galaxy-prefix/gie_proxy for proxying

      dynamic_proxy_golang_noaccess:
        type: int
        default: 60
        required: false
        desc: |
          This attribute governs the minimum length of time between consecutive HTTP/WS
          requests through the proxy, before the proxy considers a container as being
          inactive and kills it.

      dynamic_proxy_golang_clean_interval:
        type: int
        default: 10
        required: false
        desc: |
          In order to kill containers, the golang proxy has to check at some interval
          for possibly dead containers. This is exposed as a configurable parameter,
          but the default value is probably fine.

      dynamic_proxy_golang_docker_address:
        type: str
        default: unix:///var/run/docker.sock
        required: false
        desc: |
          The golang proxy needs to know how to talk to your docker daemon. Currently
          TLS is not supported, that will come in an update.

      dynamic_proxy_golang_api_key:
        type: str
        default: ''
        required: false
        desc: |
          The golang proxy uses a RESTful HTTP API for communication with Galaxy
          instead of a JSON or SQLite file for IPC. If you do not specify this, it will
          be set randomly for you. You should set this if you are managing the proxy
          manually.

      auto_configure_logging:
        type: bool
        default: true
        required: false
        desc: |
          If True, Galaxy will attempt to configure a simple root logger if a

      logging:
        type: map
        allowempty: True
        desc: |
          Controls where and how the server logs messages. If unset, the default is to log all messages to standard
          output at the level defined by the `log_level` configuration option. Configuration is described in the
          documentation at:
          https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/config_logging.html

        required: false
        desc: |
          Turn on logging of user actions to the database.  Actions currently logged
          are grid views, tool searches, and use of "recently" used tools menu.  The
          log_events and log_actions functionality will eventually be merged.

        desc: |
          Sanitize all HTML tool output.  By default, all tool output served as
          'text/html' will be sanitized thoroughly.  This can be disabled if you have
          special tools that require unaltered output.  WARNING: disabling this does
          make the Galaxy instance susceptible to XSS attacks initiated by your users.

        desc: |
          By default Galaxy will serve non-HTML tool output that may potentially
          contain browser executable JavaScript content as plain text.  This will for

          When stopping Galaxy cleanly, how much time to give various monitoring/polling
          threads to finish before giving up on joining them. Set to 0 to disable this and
          terminate without waiting. Among others, these threads include the job handler
          workers, which are responsible for preparing/submitting and collecting/finishing
          jobs, and which can cause job errors if not shut down cleanly. If using
          supervisord, consider also increasing the value of `stopwaitsecs`. If using job

          Galaxy encodes various internal values when these values will be output in
          some format (for example, in a URL or cookie).  You should set a key to be
          used by the algorithm that encodes and decodes these values. It can be any
          string with a length between 5 and 56 bytes.
          One simple way to generate a value for this is with the shell command:

          User authentication can be delegated to an upstream proxy server (usually

          If use_remote_user is enabled, the header that the upstream proxy provides
          the remote username in defaults to HTTP_REMOTE_USER (the 'HTTP_' is prepended
          by WSGI).  This option allows you to change the header.  Note, you still need
          to prepend 'HTTP_' to the header in this option, but your proxy server should
          *not* include 'HTTP_' at the beginning of the header name.

          If use_remote_user is enabled, anyone who can log in to the Galaxy host may
          impersonate any other user by simply sending the appropriate header.  Thus a
          secret shared between the upstream proxy server, and Galaxy is required.
          If anyone other than the Galaxy user is using the server, then apache/nginx
          should pass a value in the header 'GX_SECRET' that is identical to the one

          Enables GDPR Compliance mode. This makes several changes to the way
          Galaxy logs and exposes data externally such as removing emails and
          usernames from logs and bug reports. It also causes the delete user
          admin action to permanently redact their username and password, but
          not to delete data associated with the account as this is not
          currently easily implementable.

          You are responsible for removing personal data from backups.

          This forces expose_user_email and expose_user_name to be false, and
          forces user_deletion to be true to support the right to erasure.

        required: false
        desc: |
          If multiple job handlers are enabled, allow Galaxy to schedule workflow invocations
          in multiple handlers simultaneously. This is discouraged because it results in a
          less predictable order of workflow datasets within in histories.

      maximum_workflow_invocation_duration:

        desc: |
          This is the maximum amount of time a workflow invocation may stay in an active
          scheduling state in seconds. Set to -1 to disable this maximum and allow any workflow
          invocation to schedule indefinitely. The default corresponds to 1 month.

        type: int
        default: -1
        required: false
        desc: |
          Specify a maximum number of jobs that any given workflow scheduling iteration can create.
          Set this to a positive integer to prevent large collection jobs in a workflow from
          preventing other jobs from executing. This may also mitigate memory issues associated with
          scheduling workflows at the expense of increased total DB traffic because model objects
          are expunged from the SQL alchemy session between workflow invocation scheduling iterations.
          Set to -1 to disable any such maximum (the default).

      history_local_serial_workflow_scheduling:

        desc: |
          Master key that allows many API admin actions to be used without actually
          having a defined admin user in the database/config.  Only set this if you
          need to bootstrap Galaxy, you probably do not want to set this on public
          servers.

      enable_tool_tags:

        required: false
        desc: |
          Enable tool tags (associating tools with tags).  This has its own option

        default: ''
        required: false
        desc: |
          Enable Galaxy's "Upload via FTP" interface.  You'll need to install and
          configure an FTP server (we've used ProFTPd since it can use Galaxy's
          database for authentication) and set the following two options.
          This should point to a directory containing subdirectories matching users'
          identifier (defaults to e-mail), where Galaxy will look for files.

      ftp_upload_site:
        type: str
        default: ''
        required: false
        desc: |
          This should be the hostname of your FTP server, which will be provided to

      ftp_upload_dir_identifier:
        type: str
        default: email
        required: false
        desc: |
          User attribute to use as subdirectory in calculating default ftp_upload_dir
          pattern. By default this will be email so a user's FTP upload directory will be
          ${ftp_upload_dir}/${user.email}. Can set this to other attributes such as id or
          username though.

      ftp_upload_dir_template:
        type: str
        default: ${ftp_upload_dir}/${ftp_upload_dir_identifier}
        required: false

      ftp_upload_purge:
        type: bool
        default: true
        required: false

      enable_quotas:
        type: bool
        default: false

      expose_dataset_path:
        type: bool
        default: false

        desc: |
          This option allows users to see the full path of datasets via the "View
          Details" option in the history. This option also exposes the command line to

      expose_potentially_sensitive_job_metrics:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |

          Directory to store Data Manager based tool-data; defaults to tool_data_path.

      job_config_file:
        type: str
        default: config/job_conf.xml
        required: false
        desc: |
          To increase performance of job execution and the web interface, you can
          separate Galaxy into multiple processes.  There are more than one way to do
          this, and they are explained in detail in the documentation:

            https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/scaling.html

          By default, Galaxy manages and executes jobs from within a single process and
          notifies itself of new jobs via in-memory queues.  Jobs are run locally on
          the system on which Galaxy is started.  Advanced job running capabilities can
          be configured through the job configuration file.

      default_job_resubmission_condition:
        type: str
        required: false
        desc: |
          When jobs fail due to job runner problems, Galaxy can be configured to retry
          these or reroute the jobs to new destinations. Very fine control of this is
          available with resubmit declarations in job_conf.xml. For simple deployments
          of Galaxy though, the following attribute can define resubmission conditions
          for all job destinations. If any job destination defines even one
          resubmission condition explicitly in job_conf.xml - the condition described
          by this option will not apply to that destination. For instance, the condition:
          'attempt < 3 and unknown_error and (time_running < 300 or time_since_queued < 300)'
          would retry up to two times jobs that didn't fail due to detected memory or
          walltime limits but did fail quickly (either while queueing or running). The
          commented out default below results in no default job resubmission condition,
          failing jobs are just failed outright.

      track_jobs_in_database:
        type: bool
        default: true
        required: false
        desc: |
          This option is deprecated, use the `mem-self` handler assignment option in the
          job configuration instead.

      use_tasked_jobs:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          This enables splitting of jobs into tasks, if specified by the particular tool
          config.
          This is a new feature and not recommended for production servers yet.

      local_task_queue_workers:
        type: int
        default: 2
        required: false
        desc: |
          This enables splitting of jobs into tasks, if specified by the particular tool
          config.
          This is a new feature and not recommended for production servers yet.

      enable_job_recovery:
        type: bool
        default: true
        required: false
        desc: |
          Enable job recovery (if Galaxy is restarted while cluster jobs are running,
          it can "recover" them when it starts).  This is not safe to use if you are
          running more than one Galaxy server using the same database.

      retry_metadata_internally:
        type: bool
        default: true
        required: false
        desc: |
          Although it is fairly reliable, setting metadata can occasionally fail.  In
          these instances, you can choose to retry setting it internally or leave it in
          a failed state (since retrying internally may cause the Galaxy process to be
          unresponsive).  If this option is set to False, the user will be given the
          option to retry externally, or set metadata manually (when possible).

      max_metadata_value_size:
        type: int
        default: 5242880
        required: false
        desc: |
          Very large metadata values can cause Galaxy crashes.  This will allow
          limiting the maximum metadata key size (in bytes used in memory, not the end
          result database value size) Galaxy will attempt to save with a dataset.  Use
          0 to disable this feature.  The default is 5MB, but as low as 1MB seems to be
          a reasonable size.

      outputs_to_working_directory:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          This option will override tool output paths to write outputs to the job
          working directory (instead of to the file_path) and the job manager will move
          the outputs to their proper place in the dataset directory on the Galaxy
          server after the job completes. This is necessary (for example) if jobs run
          on a cluster and datasets can not be created by the user running the jobs (e.g.
          if the filesystem is mounted read-only or the jobs are run by a different
          user than the galaxy user).

      retry_job_output_collection:
        type: int
        default: 0
        required: false
        desc: |
          If your network filesystem's caching prevents the Galaxy server from seeing
          the job's stdout and stderr files when it completes, you can retry reading
          these files.  The job runner will retry the number of times specified below,
          waiting 1 second between tries.  For NFS, you may want to try the -noac mount
          option (Linux) or -actimeo=0 (Solaris).

      preserve_python_environment:
        type: str
        default: legacy_only
        required: false
        desc: |
          In the past Galaxy would preserve its Python environment when running jobs (
          and still does for internal tools packaged with Galaxy). This behavior exposes
          Galaxy internals to tools and could result in problems when activating
          Python environments for tools (such as with Conda packaging). The default
          legacy_only will restrict this behavior to tools identified by the Galaxy
          team as requiring this environment. Set this to "always" to restore the
          previous behavior (and potentially break Conda dependency resolution for many
          tools). Set this to legacy_and_local to preserve the environment for legacy
          tools and locally managed tools (this might be useful for instance if you are
          installing software into Galaxy's virtualenv for tool development).

      cleanup_job:
        type: str
        default: always
        required: false
        desc: |
          Clean up various bits of jobs left on the filesystem after completion.  These
          bits include the job working directory, external metadata temporary files,
          and DRM stdout and stderr files (if using a DRM).  Possible values are:
          always, onsuccess, never

      drmaa_external_runjob_script:

          this script is used to kill such jobs by Galaxy (e.g. if the user cancels
          the job).

      external_chown_script:

          this script is used transfer permissions back and forth between the Galaxy user
          and the user that is running the job.

      real_system_username:
        type: str
        default: user_email
        required: false
        desc: |
          When running DRMAA jobs as the Galaxy user
          (https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/cluster.html#submitting-jobs-as-the-real-user)
          Galaxy can extract the user name from the email address (actually the local-part before the @)
          or the username which are both stored in the Galaxy data base.
          The latter option is particularly useful for installations that get the
          authentication from LDAP.
          Also, Galaxy can accept the name of a common system user (eg. galaxy_worker)
          who can run every job being submitted. This user should not be the same user
          running the galaxy system.
          Possible values are user_email (default), username or <common_system_user>

      environment_setup_file:
        type: str
        default: ''
        required: false
        desc: |
          File to source to set up the environment when running jobs.  By default, the
          environment in which the Galaxy server starts is used when running jobs
          locally, and the environment set up per the DRM's submission method and
          policy is used when running jobs on a cluster (try testing with `qsub` on the
          command line).  environment_setup_file can be set to the path of a file on
          the cluster that should be sourced by the user to set up the environment
          prior to running tools.  This can be especially useful for running jobs as
          the actual user, to remove the need to configure each user's environment
          individually.

      job_resource_params_file:
        type: str
        default: config/job_resource_params_conf.xml
        required: false
        desc: |
          Optional file containing job resource data entry fields definition.
          These fields will be presented to users in the tool forms and allow them to
          overwrite default job resources such as number of processors, memory and
          walltime.

      workflow_resource_params_file:
        type: str
        default: config/workflow_resource_params_conf.xml
        required: false
        desc: |
          Similar to the above parameter, workflows can describe parameters used to
          influence scheduling of jobs within the workflow. This requires both a description
          of the fields available (which defaults to the definitions in
          job_resource_params_file if not set).

      workflow_resource_params_mapper:
        type: str
        default: config/workflow_resource_mapper_conf.yml
        required: false
        desc: |
          This parameter describes how to map users and workflows to a set of workflow
          resource parameter to present (typically input IDs from workflow_resource_params_file).
          If this this is a function reference it will be passed various inputs (workflow model
          object and user) and it should produce a list of input IDs. If it is a path
          it is expected to an XML or YAML file describing how to map group names to parameter
          descriptions (additional types of mappings via these files could be implemented but
          haven't yet - for instance using workflow tags to do the mapping).

      cache_user_job_count:
        type: bool
        default: false
        required: false
        desc: |
          If using job concurrency limits (configured in job_config_file), several
          extra database queries must be performed to determine the number of jobs a
          user has dispatched to a given destination.  By default, these queries will
          happen for every job that is waiting to run, but if cache_user_job_count is
          set to True, it will only happen once per iteration of the handler queue.
          Although better for performance due to reduced queries, the trade-off is a
          greater possibility that jobs will be dispatched past the configured limits
          if running many handlers.

          Galaxy uses AMQP internally for communicating between processes.  For
          example, when reloading the toolbox or locking job execution, the process
          that handled that particular request will tell all others to also reload,
          lock jobs, etc.
          For connection examples, see http://docs.celeryproject.org/projects/kombu/en/latest/userguide/connections.html

          Without specifying anything here, galaxy will first attempt to use your
          specified database_connection above.  If that's not specified either, Galaxy
          will automatically create and use a separate sqlite database located in your
          <galaxy>/database folder (indicated in the commented out line below).
