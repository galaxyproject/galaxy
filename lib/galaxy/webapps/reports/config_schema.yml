          When running multiple Galaxy Reports instances under separate URL prefixes on a
          single hostname, you will want to set this to the same path as the prefix set
          in the uWSGI "mount" configuration option above. This value becomes the "path"
          attribute set in the cookie so the cookies from one instance will not clobber
          those from another.

          Galaxy Reports are intended for production Galaxy instances, so sqlite (and the default value
