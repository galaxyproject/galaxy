========
Synopsis
========

This tool allows one to process an existing Galaxy dataset collection's metadata as tabular data,
apply a series of rules to it, and generate a new collection. 

===========
Description
===========

When used interactively in the tool form, a dynamic preview of the processing will be available in a tabular data viewer but this tool
may be used in workflows as well where no such preview can be generated.

This tool is an advanced feature but has a lot of flexibility - it can be used to process collections with arbitrary nesting and can do many kinds of filtering, re-sorting, nesting, flattening, and arbitrary combinations thereof not possible with Galaxy's other, more simple
collection operation tools.

More information about the rule processor in general can be found at `our training site`_.

This tool will create new history datasets from your collection but your quota usage will not increase.
