        A security credential for interacting with AWS services can be created from your
        AWS web console. Creating an "Access Key" creates a pair of keys used to identify
        and authenticate access to your AWS account - the first part of the pair  is
        "Access Key ID" and should be entered here. The second part of your key is the secret
        part called the "Secret Access Key". Place that in the secure part of this form below.
