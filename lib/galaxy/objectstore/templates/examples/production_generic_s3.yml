  description: |
    The APIs used to connect to Amazon's S3 (Simple Storage Service) have become something
    of an unofficial standard for cloud storage across a variety of vendors and services.
    Many vendors offer storage APIs compatible with S3 - Galaxy calls these ``generic_s3``
    storage locations. This template configuration allows using such service as a Galaxy storage
    location as long as you are able to find the connection details and have the relevant credentials.

    Given the amount of information needed to connect to such a service, this is a bit of an
    advanced template and probably should not be used to connect to a service if a more
    specific template is available.
  variables:
    access_key:
      label: Access Key ID
      type: string
      help: |
        The less secure part of your access tokens or access keys that describe the user
        that is accessing the data. The [Amazon documentation] calls these an "access key ID",
        the [CloudFlare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/examples/aws/boto3/)
        describes these as ``aws_access_key_id``. Internally to Galaxy, we often just call
        this the ``access_key``.
    bucket:
      label: Bucket
      type: string
      help: |
        The [bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingBucket.html) to
        store your datasets in. How to setup buckets for your storage will vary from service to service
        but all S3 compatible storage services should have the concept of a bucket to namespace
        a grouping of your data together with.
    endpoint_url:
      label: S3-Compatible API Endpoint
      type: string
      help: |
        If the documentation for your storage service has something called an ``endpoint_url``,
        For instance, the CloudFlare documentation describes its endpoints as ``https://<accountid>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com``. Here
        you would substitute your CloudFlare account ID into the endpoint url and use that value.
        So if your account ID was ``galactian``, you would enter ``galactian.r2.cloudflarestorage.com``.
        The [MinIO](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/integrations/aws-cli-with-minio.html)
        documentation describes the endpoint URL for its Play service as ``https://play.min.io:9000``,
        this whole value would be entered here.
  secrets:
    secret_key:
      label: Secret Access Key
      help: |
        The secret key used to connect to the S3 compatible storage with for the given access key.

        The [Amazon documentation] calls these an "secret access key" and
        the [CloudFlare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/examples/aws/boto3/)
        describes these as ``aws_secret_access_key``. Internally to Galaxy, we often just call
        this the ``secret_key``.
