  name: Any S3 Compatible Storage (Legacy)
  description: |
    The APIs used to connect to Amazon's S3 (Simple Storage Service) have become something
    of an unofficial standard for cloud storage across a variety of vendors and services.
    Many vendors offer storage APIs compatible with S3 - Galaxy calls these ``generic_s3``
    storage locations. This template configuration allows using such service as a Galaxy storage
    location as long as you are able to find the connection details and have the relevant credentials.

    Given the amount of information needed to connect to such a service, this is a bit of an
    advanced template and probably should not be used to connect to a service if a more
    specific template is available.
  variables:
    access_key:
      label: Access Key ID
      type: string
      help: |
        The less secure part of your access tokens or access keys that describe the user
        that is accessing the data. The [Amazon documentation] calls these an "access key ID",
        the [CloudFlare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/examples/aws/boto3/)
        describes these as ``aws_access_key_id``. Internally to Galaxy, we often just call
        this the ``access_key``.
    bucket:
      label: Bucket
      type: string
      help: |
        The [bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingBucket.html) to
        store your datasets in. How to setup buckets for your storage will vary from service to service
        but all S3 compatible storage services should have the concept of a bucket to namespace
        a grouping of your data together with.
    host:
      label: Connection Host
      type: string
      help: |
        The [hostname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname) used to connect to the target
        S3 compatible service.

        If the documentation for your storage service has something called an ``endpoint_url``,
        this can be used to determine this value. For instance, the CloudFlare documentation
        describes its endpoints as ``https://<accountid>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com``. Here
        you would substitute your CloudFlare account ID into the endpoint and shave off the ``https://``,
        so if your account ID was ``galactian``, you would enter ``galactian.r2.cloudflarestorage.com``.
    port:
      label: Connection Port
      type: integer
      default: 443
      help: |
        The [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)) used to connect
        to the target S3 compatible service. This might be ``443`` if you cannot find a relevant
        port - this is the default for secure HTTP connections.

        If the documentation for your storage service has something called an ``endpoint_url``,
        this can be used to determine this value. The [MinIO](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/integrations/aws-cli-with-minio.html)
        documentation describes the endpoint URL for its Play service as ``https://play.min.io:9000``.
        The ``:9000`` here indicates this port should be specified as ``9000``. Alternatively, the
        CloudFlare documentation describes its endpoints ``https://<accountid>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com``.
        Here there is no number at the end of the URL so the port is ``443`` as long the URL starts
        with ``https``.
    connection_path:
      label: Connection Path
      type: string
      default: ""
      help: |
        This is an advanced configuration option and it is very likely best to just keep this empty
        for most storage services. If specified, it will be the prefix in the URL for the S3 compatible
        API after the host and port to reach the target API.
    secure:
      label: Use HTTPS?
      type: boolean
      default: true
      help: |
        This is an advanced configuration option and if this option is not checked, you should not assume
        your data is secure at all. This should only ever be unchecked during testing new or experimental
        services with data and keys you do not care about.
  secrets:
    secret_key:
      label: Secret Access Key
      help: |
        The secret key used to connect to the S3 compatible storage with for the given access key.

        The [Amazon documentation] calls these an "secret access key" and
        the [CloudFlare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/examples/aws/boto3/)
        describes these as ``aws_secret_access_key``. Internally to Galaxy, we often just call
        this the ``secret_key``.
