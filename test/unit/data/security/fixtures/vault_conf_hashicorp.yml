# to run tests, start vault with:
# $ vault server -dev -dev-root-token-id=vault_application_token
# The Vault application token can is obtained using command `vault token create`.
# If running the vault server in -dev mode, a token is displayed at startup as a root token.
# For more info on how to obtain Vault tokens, see the
# [Vault documentation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/getting-started-authentication?in=vault/getting-started#token-authentication).
