# What is the UniPept Taxonomy Viewer?

This visualization allows you to explore hierarchical taxonomic datasets interactively through three dynamic views: **Treeview**, **Sunburst**, and **Treemap**.

After selecting a dataset, you can switch between the different visualization types using the buttons at the top.
Each visualization offers a unique way to inspect and understand the structure and distribution of taxonomic data.

This viewer is powered by the [Unipept Visualizations library](https://unipept.ugent.be/), an open-source toolkit for taxonomy-based visual analytics.

## Treeview

- Interactive, collapsible tree showing taxonomic hierarchy
- Scroll to zoom, drag to pan
- Click nodes to expand/collapse, right-click to set a node as new root

## Sunburst

- Radial, space-efficient view of taxonomic distribution
- Click slices to zoom into specific lineages
- Click center to zoom out

## Treemap

- Area-based view representing the relative abundance of taxa
- Click squares to zoom into taxonomic subgroups
- Right-click to zoom out

## Supported Datasets

The UniPept Taxonomy Viewer expects datasets containing a taxonomic hierarchy structure, typically produced in **d3_hierarchy** format.

## Usage Instructions

1. Select a supported dataset.
2. Wait for the viewer to load the taxonomy data.
3. Click on **Treeview**, **Sunburst**, or **Treemap** to explore the data in different forms.
4. Interact with nodes and areas for zooming, panning, and focusing on specific taxonomic groups.
