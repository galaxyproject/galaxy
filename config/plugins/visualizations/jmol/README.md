## Jmol Visualizer Plugin for Galaxy

This plugin allows you to visualize molecular structures within the Galaxy platform using [JSmol](http://wiki.jmol.org/index.php/JSmol), a powerful JavaScript library for molecular visualization.

**Usage:**

1. In your Galaxy workflow, select a dataset containing a supported molecular format (e.g., cif file).
2. Choose the "jmol Visualization" tool from the available tools.
3. The molecule will be rendered within the visualization panel. You can interact with the molecule using the controls provided by JSmol.

**Additional Notes:**

* For detailed information on JSmol and supported features, refer to the JSmol documentation: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol/)
