      Provides a software implementation of complete 3D graphics engine
      for rendering molecules and associated shapes. 
      basic shapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This package implements all graphics primitives used by Jmol. The
      graphics engine does not use Java3D or OpenGL. It requires no specialized
      graphics hardware. This allows Jmol and the JmolApplet to run on any
      machine that has a JVM.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a software implementation of a graphics z-buffer. An int[] called
      pbuf (for pixel buffer) is used to hold ARGB values for pixels. A short[]
      called zbuf holds the z-depth value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shape primitives are provided for drawing spheres, cylinders, triangles, etc.
      Shading primitives provide lighting/shading support
