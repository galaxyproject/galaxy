This file shall be properly set for user authentication and authorization leveraging OpenID Connect.
Here we provide a quick reference for configuration setters, and we provide a complete documentation
at the following page:

    https://galaxyproject.org/admin/authentication/config/



Quick Reference
_______________

- provider:         Sets the name of OpenID Connect (OIDC) Identity Provider (IdP).
                    The following IdPs are currently supported:

                        { "Google", "Globus" }

- client id:        Sets the id of this client (i.e., your Galaxy instance) with the IdP, which is
                    obtained from the IdP at client registration.
                    See: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.2

- client secret:    A secret generated by IdP for your client upon its registration.
                    See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1



IMPORTANT NOTES
_______________

While registering your client (i.e., your Galaxy instance), you would need to provide the IdP with a
`redirect_uri`: a URL at which the IdP will callback your Galaxy instance upon successful user authentication.

This URL for your Galaxy instance is composed as:

    <host_url>/authnz/<provider>/callback


Some examples:

- using localhost to authenticate with Google:
    http://localhost:8080/authnz/google/callback

- using localhost to authenticat with Globus:
    http://localhost:8080/authnz/globus/callback

- using an instance hosted at `https://usegalaxy.org` with Google:
    https://usegalaxy.org/authnz/google/callback


Please mind `http` and `https`.

<OIDC>
    <provider name="Google">
        <client_id> ... </client_id>
        <client_secret> ... </client_secret>

        <prompt>consent</prompt>
        <!--The value of this parameter (i.e., prompt) specifies whether the Google authorization server should prompt
         a galaxy user for (re)authorization and consent. The possible values are: `none`, `consent`, and
         `select_account`. HOWEVER, DO NOT USE `none`, because it will cause authentication failure for new users.
         see the following page for more information:
         https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect#prompt

         If you want the consent screen to be shown to the new users only, and re-authorization happen without
         asking for user's consent, then remove this attribute.

         NOTE: Galaxy sets OIDC 'scope' (requested scope of access to user's account) to `openid`. This is the
         minimum scope value that request only user's email address and profile name. For login process Galaxy
         does not need any more information, hence we request minimum possible information. By design, Google
         does NOT show consent screen for this scope, hence user will only see a login page when they try to
         login to Galaxy using their Google account.
