# Galaxy is configured by default to be useable in a single-user development
# environment.  To tune the application for a multi-user production
# environment, see the documentation at:
#
#  http://usegalaxy.org/production
#

# Throughout this sample configuration file, except where stated otherwise,
# uncommented values override the default if left unset, whereas commented
# values are set to the default value. Relative paths are relative to the root
# Galaxy directory.

# Examples of many of these options are explained in more detail in the wiki:

# -- Job Execution

# To increase performance of job execution and the web interface, you can
# separate Galaxy into multiple processes.  There are more than one way to do
# this, and they are explained in detail in the documentation:
#
#   https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Admin/Config/Performance/Scaling

# By default, Galaxy manages and executes jobs from within a single process and
# notifies itself of new jobs via in-memory queues.  Jobs are run locally on
# the system on which Galaxy is started.  Advanced job running capabilities can
# be configured through the job configuration file.
#job_config_file = config/job_conf.xml

# In multiprocess configurations, notification between processes about new jobs
# is done via the database.  In single process configurations, this is done in
# memory, which is a bit quicker.  Galaxy tries to automatically determine
# which method it should used based on your handler configuration in the job
# config file, but you can explicitly override this behavior by setting the
# following option to True or False.
#track_jobs_in_database = None

# This enables splitting of jobs into tasks, if specified by the particular tool config.
# This is a new feature and not recommended for production servers yet.
#use_tasked_jobs = False
#local_task_queue_workers = 2

# Enable job recovery (if Galaxy is restarted while cluster jobs are running,
# it can "recover" them when it starts).  This is not safe to use if you are
# running more than one Galaxy server using the same database.
#enable_job_recovery = True

# Although it is fairly reliable, setting metadata can occasionally fail.  In
# these instances, you can choose to retry setting it internally or leave it in
# a failed state (since retrying internally may cause the Galaxy process to be
# unresponsive).  If this option is set to False, the user will be given the
# option to retry externally, or set metadata manually (when possible).
#retry_metadata_internally = True

# If (for example) you run on a cluster and your datasets (by default,
# database/files/) are mounted read-only, this option will override tool output
# paths to write outputs to the working directory instead, and the job manager
# will move the outputs to their proper place in the dataset directory on the
# Galaxy server after the job completes.
#outputs_to_working_directory = False

# If your network filesystem's caching prevents the Galaxy server from seeing
# the job's stdout and stderr files when it completes, you can retry reading
# these files.  The job runner will retry the number of times specified below,
# waiting 1 second between tries.  For NFS, you may want to try the -noac mount
# option (Linux) or -actimeo=0 (Solaris).
#retry_job_output_collection = 0

# Clean up various bits of jobs left on the filesystem after completion.  These
# bits include the job working directory, external metadata temporary files,
# and DRM stdout and stderr files (if using a DRM).  Possible values are:
# always, onsuccess, never
#cleanup_job = always

# File to source to set up the environment when running jobs.  By default, the
# environment in which the Galaxy server starts is used when running jobs
# locally, and the environment set up per the DRM's submission method and
# policy is used when running jobs on a cluster (try testing with `qsub` on the
# command line).  environment_setup_file can be set to the path of a file on
# the cluster that should be sourced by the user to set up the environment
# prior to running tools.  This can be especially useful for running jobs as
# the actual user, to remove the need to configure each user's environment
# individually.
#environment_setup_file = None


# Optional file containing job resource data entry fields definition.
# These fields will be presented to users in the tool forms and allow them to
# overwrite default job resources such as number of processors, memory, and walltime.
#job_resource_params_file = config/job_resource_params_conf.xml

# If using job concurrency limits (configured in job_config_file), several
# extra database queries must be performed to determine the number of jobs a
# user has dispatched to a given destination.  By default, these queries will
# happen for every job that is waiting to run, but if cache_user_job_count is
# set to True, it will only happen once per iteration of the handler queue.
# Although better for performance due to reduced queries, the tradeoff is a
# greater possibility that jobs will be dispatched past the configured limits
# if running many handlers.
#cache_user_job_count = False

# ToolBox filtering
# Modules from lib/galaxy/tools/filters/ can be specified in the following lines.
# tool_* filters will be applied for all users and can not be changed by them.
# user_tool_* filters will be shown under user preferences and can be toogled
# on and off by runtime

# Galaxy Application Internal Message Queue

# Galaxy uses AMQP internally TODO more documentation on what for.
# For examples, see http://ask.github.io/kombu/userguide/connections.html
#
# Without specifying anything here, galaxy will first attempt to use your
# specified database_connection above.  If that's not specified either, Galaxy
# will automatically create and use a separate sqlite database located in your
# <galaxy>/database folder (indicated in the commented out line below).

#amqp_internal_connection = sqlalchemy+sqlite:///./database/control.sqlite?isolation_level=IMMEDIATE



# ---- Galaxy External Message Queue -------------------------------------------------

# Galaxy uses AMQ protocol to receive messages from external sources like 
# bar code scanners. Galaxy has been tested against RabbitMQ AMQP implementation.
# For Galaxy to receive messages from a message queue the RabbitMQ server has 
# to be set up with a user account and other parameters listed below. The 'host'
# and 'port' fields should point to where the RabbitMQ server is running.
