# Galaxy is configured by default to be usable in a single-user development
# environment.  To tune the application for a multi-user production

# available with resubmit declarations in job_conf.xml. For simple deployments
# of Galaxy though, the following attribute can define resubmission conditions
# for all job destinations. If any job destination defines even one
# resubmission condition explicitly in job_conf.xml - the condition described
# by this option will not apply to that destination. For instance, the condition:
# 'attempt < 3 and unknown_error and (time_running < 300 or time_since_queued < 300)'
# would retry up to two times jobs that didn't fail due to detected memory or
# walltime limits but did fail quickly (either while queueing or running). The

# failing jobs are just failed outright.

# Although it is fairly reliable, setting metadata can occasionally fail.  In

# -- Galaxy Application Internal Message Queue

# Galaxy uses AMQP internally for communicating between processes.  For
# example, when reloading the toolbox or locking job execution, the process
# that handled that particular request will tell all others to also reload,
# lock jobs, etc.
# For connection examples, see http://docs.celeryproject.org/projects/kombu/en/latest/userguide/connections.html

# ---- Galaxy External Message Queue -------------------------------------------------

# Galaxy uses Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) to receive messages from
# external sources like barcode scanners.  Galaxy has been tested against
# RabbitMQ AMQP implementation.  For Galaxy to receive messages from a message
# queue, the RabbitMQ server has to be set up with a user account and other
# parameters listed below.  The 'host' and 'port' fields should point to where
# the RabbitMQ server is running.
